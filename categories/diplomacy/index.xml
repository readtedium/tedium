      <description>Today in Tedium: If you&amp;rsquo;re watching the right digital substation, the message is hard to ignore. Ron Paul says we&amp;rsquo;re facing a catastrophic financial crisis that could leave you screwed. That&amp;rsquo;s a weird message to hear from any former politician, even one with the libertarian bonafides of Ron Paul. (His son Rand must be psyched that this is how he&amp;rsquo;s spending his retirement.) But the paid ads, which are designed to get you to buy some financial services you don&amp;rsquo;t need, nonetheless offer a funhouse mirror from which to consider the market forces that cause currency to lose its value.</description>

      <description>Today in Tedium: North America is a melting pot of the highest order, and it&amp;rsquo;s something that&amp;rsquo;s best exemplified by our junk food—a stew made of Taco Bell, ranch dressing, Sriracha, ramen noodles, and a whole lot of ground beef. But despite our disparate histories and tastes, we all made it here—some assimilating more than others. In today&amp;rsquo;s issue of Tedium, we consider some of the more unusual cultural pockets that have put a stake into the United States.</description>

      <title>This land is my land</title>

      <description>Today in Tedium: Starting your own country is not something that&amp;rsquo;s particularly easy to do. For one thing, you have no idea if it&amp;rsquo;s going to work, plus you&amp;rsquo;re stuck having to figure out annoyingly complicated details like currency, how laws will be implemented, and how you&amp;rsquo;re going to defend your borders from jerks you don&amp;rsquo;t want on your land. Czech politician Vít Jedlicka, however, thinks he&amp;rsquo;s up to the task.</description>

      <title>The Great Muppet Email</title>

      <description>Today in Tedium: The Muppets sure are awesome, aren’t they? We agree. Clearly, Jim Henson—a man who originally thought of himself more as filmmaker than puppeteer—was on an awesome kick when he came up with the idea to convince ad execs that anthropomorphic foam and rubber could be used to sell coffee. With something as long-lasting and popular as the Muppets, there&amp;rsquo;s a good chance it&amp;rsquo;ll take you in some weird directions—like Scientology, Hebrew, and fans willing to take the Muppet legacy into their own hands.</description>
