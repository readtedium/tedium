      <description>Today in Tedium: Today&amp;rsquo;s issue of Tedium is all about politicsâ€”but not in any way you might assume. In this age of absurd analytics, Twitter nontroversies, and over-the-top digital campaigns, it seems insane that a yard sign could have any effect on most people, especially for large-scale presidential campaigns. For one thing, compared to tweets and social media platforms, such signs are not cheap. And they only show logos! There are no policy statements to be found anywhere on these signs.</description>
