    <h2 itemprop="about">Vinyl records are getting all the buzz these days, but what about magnetic tapes? They&#39;re just as quirky—whether we&#39;re talking VCR or reel-to-reel.</h2>
    
    <p class="content" itemprop="description">
        Today in Tedium: When&rsquo;s the big comeback for magnetic tapes coming around, anyway? These days, vinyl is making a serious comeback with the public. Even Taylor Swift is selling a ton of vinyl records these days. But in a world where streaming and optical discs are more common than ever, the magnetic tape—which arguably has as much nostalgic hipster cachet as the vinyl record, and across a variety of formats at that—hasn&rsquo;t seen nearly as much love.

        Today in Tedium: The early Counting Crows hit &ldquo;Mr. Jones&rdquo; was a lie. Take that back—the incident was real, and Adam Duritz did hang out with a guy with the last name Jones, but the song&rsquo;s whole plotline about how they were gonna be happier when they were famous didn&rsquo;t come to pass. If you go to a Counting Crows show these days, in fact, the lyric is now &ldquo;we all wanna be big, big stars, yeah, but then we get second thoughts about that.

        Today in Tedium: The greatest six minutes that the British band Pulp ever put to wax pulled off a lot of small victories as it leaped into a larger one. &ldquo;Common People&rdquo; highlighted the lingering definitions of class that the U.K. still hasn&rsquo;t managed to shake; it drew a vibrant character sketch that few songwriters can put together in a single album, let alone a pop song; and it broke through to the mainstream at a time when most British music buyers were focused mostly on Blur and Oasis.

        Today in Tedium: Yesterday, a coworker and good friend of mine revealed to me a fact that made me feel very old. We were talking about Spotify—and his desire not to pay $10 per month for the service—and I referenced Columbia House. He did not know what I was talking about. I was taken aback by this news—I thought everyone knew what Columbia House was! The mail-order CD service (along with its competitor BMG) had a bright moment in the early &lsquo;90s, only to see its business model fall apart thanks to iTunes, and later, Spotify.

        Today in Tedium: Nearly as long as there has been the internet, there have been lists of terrible album covers—many of which predate the internet and are looked at using modern standards for humor and kitsch. But the problem with these images is that there&rsquo;s often no story behind them, because they&rsquo;re often not shared with any information to speak of. They&rsquo;re historic memes, but they never seem to have any attached history.

        Today in Tedium: 80 years ago, the nature of one of the world&rsquo;s most popular tunes changed forever. It&rsquo;s a song you&rsquo;ve probably sung before, about a bajillion times. &ldquo;Happy birthday to you, happy birthday …&rdquo; you know the rest. In 1935, &ldquo;Happy Birthday&rdquo; was copyrighted, and as a result, it&rsquo;s rare to hear the song performed in any film or concert. Today, we&rsquo;re gonna talk about copyright, traditional songs, and the ways in which people who had no role in creating those songs are making big bucks off of the unwitting public.

        Today in Tedium: If you&rsquo;ve never seen a 12-foot-tall upright piano, you&rsquo;re in for a treat. The neo-classical German musician Nils Frahm recorded his latest album, Solo, on such a device, the Klavins Model 370. Frahm told Pitchfork that the experience was so inspiring that he wanted to launch a crowdfunding effort to help the piano&rsquo;s creator, David Klavins, build an even taller instrument. (Read about that here.) Today, inspired by Frahm&rsquo;s excitement, we want to talk about some incredibly bizarre instruments.

        Today in Tedium: Late rock legend Lou Reed has been in the news lately for a somewhat odd reason. On Monday, Reed&rsquo;s sister wrote about her brother&rsquo;s medical situation during his teenage years—when, the rumor goes, his parents had him undergo electroshock therapy to fend off homosexual urges. (Lou did undergo the controversial therapy treatment, but his sister denies that latent homosexuality was the cause. Speaking of their parents, she explains: &ldquo;They were caught in a bewildering web of guilt, fear, and poor psychiatric care.

        Today in Tedium: This weekend marks the opening day of the 2015 season of Major League Baseball—a sport that you find either immensely fascinating or overrated compared to more action-packed sports like football or basketball. Baseball has never completely lost the public&rsquo;s fascination, though it&rsquo;s certainly had some rough periods over the years. And sometimes, the fans can be total jerks. Today&rsquo;s issue of Tedium covers what it&rsquo;s like to be in the midst of a crowd of annoying baseball fans.
