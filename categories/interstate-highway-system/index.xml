      <description>Today in Tedium: If you&amp;rsquo;ve had a chance to ride on Interstate 180 in Cheyenne, Wyoming, you might have noticed something strange about the road. Despite being called an &amp;ldquo;interstate,&amp;rdquo; which implies a certain set of rules about what the road should look like, it doesn&amp;rsquo;t look anything like a freeway. In fact, it&amp;rsquo;s the only interstate highway in the continental United States that doesn&amp;rsquo;t meet federal standards for being an interstate highway.</description>
