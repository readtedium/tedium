      <description>Today in Tedium: It’s often said about the current era of television that it’s an embarrassment of riches, one of the best eras of television of all time, in part because the floodgates have bumped up the quality quotient. Netflix creates so much stuff (some great, much average) that we’re unaware of nearly all of it! It’s weird to think about, but both cable TV and local syndication had a similar effect on television in the ’80s.</description>

      <description>Today in Tedium: I’m going to say it right now—we totally got lucky with our acquisition of the Genesis Storytime video earlier this month, which, while it didn’t bring in millions of views, may be the most impressive thing we’ve ever done. (Nice work, Andrew!) More likely, a hunt for an obscure video will end in tears, possibly a dead end. (We were not the first people to hunt for video of that channel.</description>

      <description>Hey guys, Ernie here with another piece from Andrew Egan about something nerdy and televised, two things we do well here at Tedium. (His last piece was a daily one about Beer Nuts.) Read on for more!
Today in Tedium: Television programming has long been a rotating series of common staples. Talk shows, games shows, court shows, and soap operas air during the day. Sitcoms, dramas, and reality competitions (which are somehow distinct from game shows) dominate prime time hours.</description>

      <title>Our Next Annoying National Upgrade</title>

      <description>Today in Tedium: With all the recent chatter about Ajit Pai’s aggressive attempt to roll back net neutrality standards, it’s easy for other parts of the Federal Communications Commission’s winding docket to get lost. But there are things that the FCC is doing beyond ruining your internet that are worth discussing. One of those things is the recent passage of a measure to allow the voluntary rollout of ATSC 3.0, a television transmission standard that could rejigger the way we watch the boob tube.</description>

      <description>Today in Tedium: When I grew up, I listened to a lot of John Denver. Well, not really full songs, so much as the 10-second snippets of tunes that played during his commercials on late-night cable TV. “You fill up my senses like a night in the forest,” Denver sang to the masses, even though he was really only singing to Annie, his first wife. But those choruses and hooks had a way of bleeding together into one super-song.</description>

      <description>Today in Tedium: The remote control was an important invention, not just because it saved the average person a couple of steps, but because it shares a clear lineage with every other handheld electronics device ever made. Your smartphone looks like it does because of the remote control. But less heralded—perhaps because of its roots as an aftermarket device—is the universal remote control, a device that made millions of devices that work similarly but are slightly different bend to its will.</description>

      <title>Too Terrible For Television</title>
      <link>/2017/01/20/weird-unsold-television-pilots/</link>

      <description>Today in Tedium: The idea that there should be limits on the quality of what ends up on or TV screens is a common one that’s been around for ages. Hell, that’s why one of the defining shows of the 1980s is called You Can’t Do That On Television. Which is why, in a weird way, it kind of makes sense that many of the new shows actually getting on the air in 2017 are actually revivals of successful ones—including, as was just announced, Will and Grace.</description>

      <title>What&#39;s Your Gimmick?</title>

      <description>Today in Tedium: These days, it seems like TV is all about gimmicks: Think reality shows, TV shows that recap the TV shows that literally just aired, limited series designed to recycle old hit shows, and even live theatre productions like The Wiz. TV executives are like P.T. Barnum-style hucksters, willing to try anything to keep us watching. And it&amp;rsquo;s always been that way, honestly—if they can make watching your boob tube into an &amp;ldquo;event,&amp;rdquo; they know they&amp;rsquo;ve sucked you in.</description>

      <title>Ted Turner&#39;s Satellite Of Love</title>

      <description>Today in Tedium: For a brief moment in time, independent local television stations held an impressive level of power over the country as a whole. They could share regional messages with national audiences, advertise to millions more people than they ever could on their crusty UHF signals, and punch far above their potential. The era of the superstation is past, but it undeniably had a massive effect on cable television. Don&amp;rsquo;t change the dial, because we&amp;rsquo;re talking about cable TV&amp;rsquo;s turning point.</description>
