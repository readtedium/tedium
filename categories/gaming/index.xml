      <description>Today in Tedium: In an era when digital storage is basically unlimited and space is running out by the second, there’s still a basic charm to physical objects that we’ve yet to really lose. Video games are a great example of this. Despite the fact that you can literally download any game under the sun and play it instantly, there is a quite healthy business online and elsewhere for physical product.</description>

      <description>Today in Tedium: Recently, I had a big problem really put a damper on my retro-gaming experience. After modding my Super NES Classic, I proceeded to play one of my all-time favorite games, The Legend of the Mystical Ninja. I got all the way up to level 5, but when I ran into that level’s boss, something strange happened: The entire system crashed, hard. What happened? Well, the Super NES Classic’s emulator couldn’t handle what was on the screen.</description>

      <description>“A Bloodlust game was clearly a Bloodlust game,” Bloodlust visual artist Ethan Petty told me. “Some people loved it. Some people thought it was visual torture. I was with the second group, but hey—we had to keep creating. It was what we loved.”  Of the many fascinating things about Bloodlust Software and its emulators—NESticle in particular, but also Genecyst and Callus—was that there was a distinctive visual style that went along with them.</description>

      <description>What if we reported on the past like it was happening in the present day—not reflecting on it nostalgically like I do at Tedium, but literally trying to cover the past as if you had no knowledge of the future?  It sounds like an odd thought exercise, but in reality, it’s a whole lot of fun, based on the website Nintendo Times. Since 2015, the writer and blogger Craig Majaski, who cut his teeth at the long-running gaming site Gaming Age, has been editing and putting together a site in which 30-year-old discussions and interviews about the early days of the Nintendo Entertainment System are published as if they’re happening in real time.</description>

      <description>Today in Tedium: Forcing education and entertainment together is a great way to ensure you don’t really do either all that well. (Case in point: The Jack Hanna repeat wasteland, targeted toward young teens as part of an advertising loophole, that is FCC-mandated educational television on broadcast stations.) Games are no exception. In the infancy of computers, educators quickly figured out that computer games could be a great vessel for both education and entertainment.</description>

      <title>Big in Brazil</title>

      <description>Today in Tedium: Here’s a true fact that will blow your mind—the game-maker Sega started out as an American company, not as a Japanese one. Sure, much of its success came about after it moved to Japan, but it was not by any means a company that necessarily needed Japan, like notable competitors Nintendo, Sony, and NEC did. While the company had one solid era of major success in the American market—where the Sega Genesis went toe-to-toe with the Super NES and became one of the most popular systems of the ‘90s—it was Brazil where Sega really came into its own.</description>

      <title>The Game Genie Generation</title>

      <description>Today in Tedium: For kids of a certain age, the Game Genie was a life-changer. Literally. It could change the number of lives you had in whatever cartridge you put it on, as well as do a bunch of other crazy things to the game you were playing. It provided a thrill that we&amp;rsquo;ve kinda gotten away from as video games have grown more complex, but the device leaves behind a rich legacy.</description>

      <title>8-Bit Archaeology</title>

      <description>Today in Tedium: Here&amp;rsquo;s something you probably don&amp;rsquo;t know about me. For a couple years in the late-&amp;lsquo;90s and early 2000s, I got my sea legs in writing from a little site called Zophar&amp;rsquo;s Domain, a console emulation enthusiast site. At the time, ZD held a kind of legendary status among retro gamers, and though it&amp;rsquo;s aged some, it&amp;rsquo;s still around. (Here&amp;rsquo;s what it looked like when I was there.) I&amp;rsquo;m not really much of a gamer anymore, but this stuff still holds a place in my heart.</description>
