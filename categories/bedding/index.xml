      <description>As you guys may or may not know, my first really big piece on Tedium was a takedown of sorts on hipster mattresses. It pondered the idea of how the companies came to prominence, as well as what it would take to start up a company just like this. It was absurd, but it was fun to write. It’s currently the top-ranking item on Google for the term “hipster mattress.”  Since then, I’ve gotten, somewhat like clockwork, repeated emails asking if I might add links to my website to promote either other mattress companies, or websites that review mattresses.</description>

      <description>Today in Tedium: Is there anything more annoying than a mattress company that thinks it&amp;rsquo;s clever? It&amp;rsquo;s weird, but in the past year or so, we&amp;rsquo;ve seen a whole boatload of companies that want to turn the process of buying a mattress into something fun. But buying mattresses shouldn&amp;rsquo;t be fun. It should be work, something you do once or twice in your life and forget about after you&amp;rsquo;ve gotten over the frustration of getting the mattress into your bedroom.</description>

      <title>The Stupidity of Making the Bed</title>

      <description>Today in Tedium: It&amp;rsquo;s one of the most annoying possible tasks out there—a chore with limited value that gets undone every single night. Unlike tying your shoes, making your bed doesn&amp;rsquo;t protect you or significantly improve your life. It&amp;rsquo;s an aesthetic task at best. Yet, for some reason, we as a society value this form of busywork way too freaking much. There are people who swear by folding their blanket over two sets of sheets, perfectly creasing the top sheet under the mattress, but I&amp;rsquo;m not one of those people.</description>
