      <description>Today in Tedium: Every once of our file formats has a story. The GIF, for example, came to being thanks to a need to serve up images on pokey Compuserve connections with limited RAM. The MP3, meanwhile, was built around the contours of Suzanne Vega’s unaccompanied voice on “Tom’s Diner.” And the ZIP file came to life in a brutal legal battle that was egged on by the whims of BBS users.</description>

      <description>You may or may not have noticed this, but Tedium relies pretty heavily on archival content to exist. This newsletter and publication is not just about offering up weird facts: It&amp;rsquo;s often about introducing facts that have otherwise been forgotten about by the public at large.  Sometimes, this takes me in some interesting directions. An example I regularly cite is my piece on lemon juice squeeze bottles. It was the rare piece I had the chance to mostly write ahead of time, and while there were some incredibly useful starting points on the issue from the Beach Packaging Design, I find it important that, even if an existing resource like this offers a starting point, I spend time doing some digging of my own.</description>

      <description>Editor&amp;rsquo;s note: I wrote this on Medium last night, but am also sharing here in hopes of giving this issue the attention it deserves.
I write stuff that is driven on research. It’s an important part of what I do. That research takes me weird places—into patent filings, reading news stories that are decades old, diving into snippets of old books, hoping that something—anything—will get me closer to the end of the story.</description>
