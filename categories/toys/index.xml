      <description>Today in Tedium: Four decades ago this month, a company that helped set the stage for the modern computing era got into the toy market thanks to an announcement at the 1978 Summer Consumer Electronics Show. While it wasn’t the first time that kids got their hands on something truly electronic, its influence ran deep, even as its technology was fairly primitive. With its robotic voice and limited memory, the Speak &amp;amp; Spell somehow mixed the seemingly incompatible worlds of education and entertainment in an impressive way.</description>

      <description>Today in Tedium: With Black Friday past us, this is about the time of year when gift lists start being written by kids who are still fairly new to writing. Over the years, toys like Teddy Ruxpin and the Super Nintendo floated up to the top of many of these lists. But those toys have faded away, for the most part. Power Wheels, on the other hand? The battery driven cars are very much still with us, still in stores, and still likely to be on some kid’s list this year.</description>

      <description>Today in Tedium: The &amp;lsquo;80s were by and large a time of peace for the United States. The Cold War was thawing, and most of the conflicts the U.S. did get in took place over secured phone lines, rather than on the battlefield. Pop culture was far more likely to arm itself to the teeth during this era: Military-inspired cartoons like G.I. Joe: A Real American Hero ruled the after-school airwaves, while films like Rambo and stars like Chuck Norris and Dolph Lundgren were bringing explosive military action to the cineplex.</description>

      <description>Today in Tedium: If you grew up in the &amp;lsquo;80s, you already you probably know this, but that decade&amp;rsquo;s toy industry was a fascinating place. At this juncture, parents were already used to having to get batteries for their kids&amp;rsquo; toys, and at the same time, primitive computing technology was just getting cheap enough that it could be integrated into those toys. Some companies, like Tiger Electronics, doubled down on the cheap silicon and thrived.</description>
