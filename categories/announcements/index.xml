      <description>I have to admit, I kind of loved the idea of launching this site with a slab-serif font. Slab-serifs, with their hard edges and consistent widths, have a lot of character, and I&amp;rsquo;ve always loved the feel that they&amp;rsquo;ve given my work over the years. I loved using them when I still designed newspapers, and I love using them now. A while back, I found a good one, and it has treated me wellâ€”both at Tedium, and the last iteration of my old site ShortFormBlog.</description>
