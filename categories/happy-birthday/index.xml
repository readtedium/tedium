      <description>Today in Tedium: 80 years ago, the nature of one of the world&amp;rsquo;s most popular tunes changed forever. It&amp;rsquo;s a song you&amp;rsquo;ve probably sung before, about a bajillion times. &amp;ldquo;Happy birthday to you, happy birthday …&amp;rdquo; you know the rest. In 1935, &amp;ldquo;Happy Birthday&amp;rdquo; was copyrighted, and as a result, it&amp;rsquo;s rare to hear the song performed in any film or concert. Today, we&amp;rsquo;re gonna talk about copyright, traditional songs, and the ways in which people who had no role in creating those songs are making big bucks off of the unwitting public.</description>
