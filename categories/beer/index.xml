      <description>If you’re a certain age or tend to watch TV shows from a certain time, you might remember the ubiquity of the humble beer nut. Almost any sitcom in the ’80s or early ’90s that involves a bar will mention beer nuts at some point. Here’s Norm Peterson using beer nuts in a clunky analogy about women:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weBbZ11d5LM
And of course, there are the mandatory Simpsons references, such as when Homer buys “Kwik-E-Mart No Name Brand Beer Nuts” or when a fake beer nuts can is spring loaded with snakes.</description>

      <description>Editor’s note: In honor of Guinness’ recent move to full veganism, I’m reviving an old post of mine and getting it up to date. It wasn’t an easy task with all those fish bladders. &amp;ldquo;Wait, fish bladders?&amp;rdquo; Keep reading …
Today in Tedium: Meat is in the news a lot these days, it seems. One study claims that animal fat might lower your cholesterol level, while a completely different one suggests meat affects your gut bacteria or causes blood clots.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m not a very good cook, though I&amp;rsquo;ve gotten better over the years. One of the best examples of my culinary struggles involved an infamous attempt to create a concoction I called &amp;ldquo;French toast hummus,&amp;rdquo; an idea that started as an inside joke with my friends that I for some reason attempted to follow through with in an attempt to make the joke even funnier. Problem was, the joke was on me.</description>

      <description>Today in Tedium: When it comes to products we eat or drink, we love our gimmicks. In the past two days alone, Crystal Pepsi has returned to the shelves after a 23-year absence and Burger King tried putting a Whopper in a tortilla wrap. Those are great gimmicks that will win some pretty killer business for those brands, despite the likely high calorie counts of each item. (A 20-ounce bottle of Crystal Pepsi has 250 calories.</description>

      <description>Today in Tedium: How arrogant do you have to be to name your product after an entire country, to assume that you&amp;rsquo;ve earned that right? On Tuesday, the no-longer-American company Anheuser-Busch InBev announced that it was temporarily changing the name of its inexplicably popular beverage Budweiser to America, ahead of the 2016 election. &amp;ldquo;It’s something that we could have not done overnight. If we’d launched Budweiser yesterday, as a new brand, we probably wouldn&amp;rsquo;t have had the license to do it,&amp;rdquo; Budweiser Vice President Ricardo Marques told Fast Company&amp;rsquo;s design vertical.</description>

      <description>Today in Tedium: Meat is in the news a lot these days, it seems. We all know about the cancer story, but really, we&amp;rsquo;re more interested in the tales of meat being where it shouldn&amp;rsquo;t be. It started a couple of weeks ago, when a startup named Clear Foods analyzed a bunch of hot dogs and found that many veggie dogs had remnants of meat on them due to the production process—enough to make any vegan lose his-or-her you-know-what.</description>
