      <description>Hey guys, Ernie here with an item from a brand new writer for the newsletter, Karen Corday. Today, she has a whole lot to tell you about sniglets. What’s a sniglet? Read on to find out.
&amp;nbsp;
Today in Tedium: Comedian Rich Hall introduced sniglets—“any word that doesn’t appear in the dictionary but should”—in 1982 on the HBO comedy news show Not Necessarily the News. Several books followed, three of which were New York Times best-sellers, along with a daily comic panel and assorted sniglets merchandise.</description>

      <description>Today in Tedium: Word processors are generally kind of boring—they do their job, and that&amp;rsquo;s about it. Most people don&amp;rsquo;t put a ton of second thought into their word processors. As you might have noticed from my rant from a couple of months ago, I&amp;rsquo;m not that kind of person. That rant drew up a lot of conversation, most of it good and interesting. (It did have its critics, but even their comments were interesting!</description>

      <description>Today in Tedium: In their own quiet ways, spelling and grammar are each forms of lobbying. Language is one of the few facts of everyday life that started out as a variety of opinions on what things should be called. And those opinions, like a diamond pressed into form, slowly molded into a definitive shape. But there&amp;rsquo;s a limit to how much we&amp;rsquo;re OK with as a society—hence the popularity of dictionaries and style guides, which draw up a map for how we use words on a daily basis.</description>

      <description>Today in Tedium: Language is constantly expanding in numerous ways—and in tends to make us uncomfortable to see a new bastardization of the language, even a good one. A recent study noted that the evolution of language has lots in common with the shifts in DNA throughout history, though with one major difference: As a society becomes more insular, the genetic makeup becomes more same-y, but the language becomes more interesting.</description>
