      <description>Today in Tedium: When we go to a hotel, especially a nice one where we&amp;rsquo;re dropping a couple hundred bucks for a single night&amp;rsquo;s stay, we expect a lot out of the experience—something nicer than our schlubby apartment, preferably with an exotic or urban locale easily in sight.

In fact, it&amp;rsquo;s the only interstate highway in the continental United States that doesn&amp;rsquo;t meet federal standards for being an interstate highway.</description>
