      <description>Editor’s note: With the idea of treating my work as something of a living document, I sometimes update old Tedium issues in an effort to keep them up to date. When I was updating this one, though, I noticed something weird, and as a result, I wrote a much bigger update than usual. Read on, pals.
Today in Tedium: Schools are weird. They get super-political about the strangest things, because kids tend to get hung up about stupid things and those stupid things tend to affect what happens in the classroom.</description>

      <description>If you know anything about school lunches, it’s this: Trying new things on the menu isn’t always the best idea.  But that didn’t stop the Charlotte-Mecklenburg School District from introducing a new product called the “Char-Meck-A-Nator.” What’s a “Char-Meck-A-Nator” you ask? Well, it’s a sandwich with a ground beef patty, with cheese mixed in, and tomato ketchup baked on the top of the burger patty.
If that sounds like meatloaf on a bun, that’s because it’s freakin&amp;rsquo; meatloaf on a bun.</description>

      <description>the thing with uppercase letters is that if they aren’t there, you start to miss them after a while. they tend to carry a certain weight about them, one that speaks to a certain authority.
(IT’S AN AUTHORITY LOST WHEN EVERY SINGLE LETTER IS UPPERCASE.)
recently, this became an issue for the students of Quinnipiac university, because their school decided to change its logo without uppercasing the u.
angry petitions were filed, and complaints on social media followed.</description>
