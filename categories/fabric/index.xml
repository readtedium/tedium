      <description>Today in Tedium: This newsletter/information feed is many things, but it’s not a fashion blog. We’re anything but fashionable.

I had to do a deep dive to understand this trend and understand why corduroy, of all fabrics, was important.</description>

      <description>Today in Tedium: Last week, there was a tag on an item on my clothing that was so uncomfortable that there was nothing I wanted to do more than pull it off—to send that miserable tag to a recycling bin where it would never again see the light of day. But that annoying tag got me to thinking: Where did clothing tags come from, and who decided that an annoying tag was an important thing to have on a piece of clothing?</description>
