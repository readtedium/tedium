        Today in Tedium: Did you hear the news? They&rsquo;re taking the color out of Trix. The General Mills cereal is one of the most recent victims of a move towards more natural food, and in an effort to appease the suddenly health-conscious public, the company will be removing some of the artificial coloring from Trix and all of its other cereals. &ldquo;We wanted to make sure they were still fun vibrant colors that we are providing and the fruity flavor that kids expect,&rdquo; cereal developer Kate Gallager told Good Morning America of the move back in June.

        Today in Tedium: if you&rsquo;ve been reading us for a while, you might notice a common theme in the pieces we send out to you guys. Often, our strangest issues take things common (but mundane), and discover a secret history hiding under your nose. From belly buttons to bandages to veggie burgers, no subject is too mundane for us. If you use it, there&rsquo;s probably a great story as to how it got there.

        Today in Tedium: The phone book isn&rsquo;t really anyone&rsquo;s idea of an innovative product, but it definitely had its place on the shelf of many a home before the internet took over. In the late throes of the age of the white pages, however, an unusually large magazine stole the hearts of many a techie, and in the process became something of a bible for people looking to replace their 286 with a 486—and maybe buy a laser printer in the process.

        Today in Tedium: Vending machines are one of the few things keeping us away from the dream of a cashless society. The devices, which offer up an array of items for a little bit of pocket change, are silent but prevalent. They represent some of our most technologically advanced furniture, and they&rsquo;ll probably always be there for us in our time of need. Today&rsquo;s Tedium discusses their history—along with why, for some reason, they make us want to steal stuff.

        Today in Tedium: Rich people care about their grass way more than normal people do. Now, rarely is this an issue, but in recent months, the ongoing California drought has made this mundane issue a political one. This week, the city of Rancho Santa Fe became a target of this culture clash after _The Washington Post_ highlighted the water-rationing requirement it soon faces. Local residents aren&rsquo;t happy. “When we bought, we didn’t plan on getting a place that looks like we’re living in an African savanna,” said conservative radio host and local resident Steve Yuhas.

Gertrude Weaver barely even had a chance to celebrate her newfound reign as the world&rsquo;s oldest woman—she died a mere five days after the title changed hands, at age 116.

        Today in Tedium: Talk about the ultimate after-school job: Back in 1979, an Ottawa television station decided to create a children&rsquo;s television show basically because they were contractually obligated to as part of an agreement with the Canadian government. Their solution to this problem was to create a sketch comedy show, hiring local teenagers, nearly all of whom had no acting experience, to recreate the magic of _Monty Python_ and Saturday Night Live, without a matching budget.
