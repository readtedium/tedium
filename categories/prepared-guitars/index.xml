      <description>Today in Tedium: Of the many fascinating experiments on the internet these days involving red hot nickel balls, my personal favorite is this one, involving two guitars. This clip, apparently inspired by nickel-ball innovator Matthew Neuland&amp;rsquo;s uncle, at first attempted to show whether a fiery nickel ball would put the guitar out of tune. Then Neuland used the nickel ball to destroy the strings. It&amp;rsquo;s far from the first example of someone messing with guitar strings just to see what might happenâ€”in fact, there&amp;rsquo;s something of a whole subgenre of guitar playing based on the concept of modifying or breaking guitars in unusual ways.</description>
