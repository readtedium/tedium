      <description>Today in Tedium: These days, it seems like TV is all about gimmicks: Think reality shows, TV shows that recap the TV shows that literally just aired, limited series designed to recycle old hit shows, and even live theatre productions like The Wiz. TV executives are like P.T. Barnum-style hucksters, willing to try anything to keep us watching. And it&amp;rsquo;s always been that way, honestly—if they can make watching your boob tube into an &amp;ldquo;event,&amp;rdquo; they know they&amp;rsquo;ve sucked you in.</description>

      <description>Today in Tedium: &amp;rdquo;You don&amp;rsquo;t have to go home, but you can&amp;rsquo;t stay here,&amp;rdquo; Grammy award-winning songwriter Dan Wilson frequently sings to the unwashed masses at many a college town bar around the country. (Fun fact: He won that Grammy not with Semisonic, but for writing a Dixie Chicks song.) And often, they don&amp;rsquo;t go home. Instead, they go to restaurants made for easing the next morning&amp;rsquo;s hangovers. Or they do go home, but then they order late-night food that gets delivered to dorm rooms so fast, they freak.</description>

      <description>Today in Tedium: For a brief moment in time, independent local television stations held an impressive level of power over the country as a whole. They could share regional messages with national audiences, advertise to millions more people than they ever could on their crusty UHF signals, and punch far above their potential. The era of the superstation is past, but it undeniably had a massive effect on cable television. Don&amp;rsquo;t change the dial, because we&amp;rsquo;re talking about cable TV&amp;rsquo;s turning point.</description>

      <description>Today in Tedium: Talk about the ultimate after-school job: Back in 1979, an Ottawa television station decided to create a children&amp;rsquo;s television show basically because they were contractually obligated to as part of an agreement with the Canadian government. Their solution to this problem was to create a sketch comedy show, hiring local teenagers, nearly all of whom had no acting experience, to recreate the magic of _Monty Python_ and Saturday Night Live, without a matching budget.</description>

      <description>Today in Tedium: It may have been the greatest text message my wife had ever sent me. While I was in the middle of a deep sleep, she sent me a message informing me of the existence of a television show that raised the bar for quality late-night television on Saturday evenings. When I woke up and finally saw it, I knew that my life would never be the same, thanks to the fact that I know know that Grown Folks Dancing is a thing.</description>
