      <description>Today in Tedium: Have you heard the good news? Frozen food is back, baby!

The future is frozen, and if you’re not warming up to cold foods, you’re not cool. With tonight’s Tedium, I’d like to focus on one specific kind of food put on ice, the frozen pizza, and why it’s become an icon of prepared American food.</description>
