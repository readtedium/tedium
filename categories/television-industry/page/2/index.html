    <p class="content" itemprop="description">
        Today in Tedium: Terrible product ideas are a dime a dozen, but what about ideas that are fascinating, and perhaps executionally sound, but conceptually flawed? How often do they come about? And how often is it that they stick around the market for 17 years, despite fairly limited public interest? Such is the case of WebTV, the set-top device that allowed you to surf a television-optimized version of the web. On September 18, 1996—20 years ago this week—a startup firm released a device that meant to bring the internet to the living room.

    <h2 itemprop="about">Listening to 87.7 FM? That&#39;s not a radio station, but an old analog TV station—channel 6, to be exact. It&#39;s a total fluke, but Chicago&#39;s all over it.</h2>
    
    <p class="content" itemprop="description">
        Today in Tedium: TV on the Radio isn&rsquo;t just the name of a really freaking good band. Instead, it&rsquo;s a quirk of the design of analog television. But a funny thing happened on the way to obscurity: As analog TV gave way to digital, a handful of risk-taking broadcasters, sensing an opportunity, have started to run those analog TV stations as FM radio stations—big FCC plans be damned. The shift is surprisingly contentious in the world of broadcast.

    <p class="content" itemprop="description">
        Today in Tedium: It was an explosion that only the aliens saw coming. Almost exactly 20 years ago, the film Independence Day hit theaters and featured perhaps the single most iconic visual effect of the 1990s—a short, but effective shot of The White House getting destroyed by a gigantic alien mothership. The scene is memorable for a lot of reasons, one of which is that it looked pretty realistic. If you&rsquo;re like me, you probably are wondering: How did they get that set to look so, uh, White House-y?

        Today in Tedium: The move of the television airwaves from analog to digital in 2009 was perhaps the most unusual case of planned obsolescence in the modern age. Here was a decision, mandated by the Telecommunications Act of 1996 and forced upon hundreds of millions of people at once, that threw lots of people out of their routine. Many folks weren&rsquo;t ready, or maybe they didn&rsquo;t care enough about their TV signal quality to upgrade.

        Today in Tedium: In terms of finding out what&rsquo;s on the boob tube at any given time, we&rsquo;ve come a long way from the overly condensed pages of TV Guide. In fact, the magazine was already looking awful obsolete in the 1980s and 1990s, when cable systems around the country began dedicating entire channels to listing TV schedules. Eventually, the approach led to the rise of the set-top box, the power-sucking block that serves as the liaison between you and your cable company.

TV executives are like P.T. Barnum-style hucksters, willing to try anything to keep us watching. And it&rsquo;s always been that way, honestly—if they can make watching your boob tube into an &ldquo;event,&rdquo; they know they&rsquo;ve sucked you in.

    <p class="content" itemprop="description">
        Today in Tedium: As a whole, the most interesting time for television was the late 1970s and early 1980s. It was an era when most networks were still willing to experiment and the technology wasn’t so locked down that an enthusiast couldn’t get around it. Comcast existed back then, but it wasn’t the juggernaut it is now; DirecTV and Dish Network hadn’t yet taken their current forms. The result was that satellite dishes—which were really freaking massive back then—were only starting to take off, and there was nothing really stopping people willing to buy a dish from investing once and getting all their shows for free after that.

Between long stays on sets and a formative experience in the public spotlight, it’s no wonder that some former child stars resort to using drugs, going crazy on reality shows, or licking donuts. On the plus side, you still get to go to school—but even there, the experience is anything but traditional. There may be some really good on-set teachers, but sometimes it’s just a drunk guy trying to freeload on a movie set rather than teach kids algebra.

        Today in Tedium: 80 years ago, the nature of one of the world&rsquo;s most popular tunes changed forever. It&rsquo;s a song you&rsquo;ve probably sung before, about a bajillion times. &ldquo;Happy birthday to you, happy birthday …&rdquo; you know the rest. In 1935, &ldquo;Happy Birthday&rdquo; was copyrighted, and as a result, it&rsquo;s rare to hear the song performed in any film or concert. Today, we&rsquo;re gonna talk about copyright, traditional songs, and the ways in which people who had no role in creating those songs are making big bucks off of the unwitting public.
