      <description>Today in Tedium: Going to a restaurant is a game of expectations. We expect certain things out of the experience, based on the set parameters when we walk in the door. If we&amp;rsquo;re going to Mickey D&amp;rsquo;s, we expect our food pretty fast and fairly low-quality. If the restaurant doesn&amp;rsquo;t have a counter, we expect a menu at the table. And when we sit down at a restaurant—in the United States, at least—we expect a couple of glasses of water ready to go to help satiate our appetites.</description>
