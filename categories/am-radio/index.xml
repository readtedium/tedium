      <description>Today in Tedium: Barring our constant debates on net neutrality, one of the places where the Federal Communications Commission has the largest footprint is with our wireless spectrum. It’s a spectrum that has to serve many minders, and there are constant complaints about the spectrum being crowded. But those complaints, despite feeling modern and up-to-date, are far from new—we’ve been dealing with them pretty much ever since there was spectrum regulation.</description>

      <description>Today in Tedium: For decades, television owners haven&amp;rsquo;t been content with simply embracing the options already in front of them. There are lots of tales of this nature throughout TV history—from the people who owned (or in some cases, built) massive satellite dishes so they could pick up obscure television signals from other parts of the world, to the public-access weirdos who have long created their own kinds of television (some of whom got really lucky), to the people who got obsessed with the Amiga in the &amp;lsquo;90s.</description>
