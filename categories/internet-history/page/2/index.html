        Today in Tedium: Every time I use pieces of the early internet, I get this warm feeling in my chest. It&rsquo;s hard to describe, but I imagine it&rsquo;s a feeling not unlike the feeling that went through the crowd during the Sex Pistols concert at Manchester&rsquo;s Lesser Free Trade Hall on June 4, 1976. There&rsquo;s a sense of purity and simplicity there that is hard to recapture through other means—the sense that I&rsquo;m witnessing something culturally important that, in its own way, could change the world.

        Today in Tedium: You know something you can’t get through the internet’s wires, at least not on its own? Food. We’ve been working on it for years, but no, we’re not at the point where we can deliver nourishment directly via the series of tubes. But food has always been something of a means to an end—a way of driving the internet forward, making it something people would actually like to use.

        Today in Tedium: As the recent vote in Congress over online privacy rules reminded us, people tend to hate their internet service providers.

The internet is obviously a pretty key example of this issue in action, with products like WebTV and CompuServe imagining a specific direction for reading content online.

        Let’s face facts: Having an awesome domain name is no guarantee for success. This was proven just a couple of weeks ago in my piece about the failure of Pets.com. But it still highlights a whole lot of potential.  Which is why the recent domain sale of Cats.com—literally, an entire domain name for the internet’s favorite animal—is one that we should closely watch. The domain is currently sitting at $125,000 on the auction site Flippa, and will sell to the highest bidder in the next five days.

It also had little in common with the free-for-all that allows for the creation of all sorts of terrible/fascinating content online by random folks.

In 1996, it was a coming-out party for the web. In 2000, the growth of online news began to have an impact on how we researched candidates.

Such is the case of WebTV, the set-top device that allowed you to surf a television-optimized version of the web.
