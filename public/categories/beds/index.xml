[big]Today in Tedium: Is there anything more annoying than a mattress company that thinks it&amp;rsquo;s clever? It&amp;rsquo;s weird, but in the past year or so, we&amp;rsquo;ve seen a whole boatload of companies that want to turn the process of buying a mattress into something fun. But buying mattresses shouldn&amp;rsquo;t be fun. It should be work, something you do once or twice in your life and forget about after you&amp;rsquo;ve gotten over the frustration of getting the mattress into your bedroom.</description>

      <description>[big]As you guys may or may not know, my first really big piece on Tedium was a takedown of sorts on hipster mattresses. It pondered the idea of how the companies came to prominence, as well as what it would take to start up a company just like this. It was absurd, but it was fun to write. It’s currently the top-ranking item on Google for the term “hipster mattress.”[/big]</description>
