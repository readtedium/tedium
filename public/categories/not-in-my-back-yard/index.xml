[big]Today in Tedium: Here&amp;rsquo;s a tough problem. People love their cell phones, but the they hate the towers necessary to make those phones function. In fact, they really piss many people off, leading to situations where unnecessary fear-mongering wins the day, or leading people to worry that the towers will become eyesores that destroy their property values—or worse.

Odds are that if you live in a state north of the Mason-Dixon line, you&amp;rsquo;ve probably seen a dead leaf or two on the dirty ground.</description>
