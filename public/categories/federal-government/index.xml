[big]Today in Tedium: If you&amp;rsquo;ve had a chance to ride on Interstate 180 in Cheyenne, Wyoming, you might have noticed something strange about the road.

In fact, it&amp;rsquo;s the only interstate highway in the continental United States that doesn&amp;rsquo;t meet federal standards for being an interstate highway.</description>

Well … someone read Evernote’s policy and found out that they were going to let engineers have access to user notes in an anonymized fashion.</description>
