[big]Today in Tedium: In 1971, advocates for recycling had a big breakthrough in the state of Oregon. The state became the first in the United States to require a deposit on bottled beverages sold within its borders. Suddenly, lazy people had a financially fruitful excuse to return bottles to their local stores—because if they did, they could make a little money. Since then, however, the diminishing returns of the nickel—the financial reward for recycling a can or bottle in most states that followed suit—has led to a dip in those taking part in the program.</description>

[big]Today in Tedium: It took us about a hundred years to turn film processing (in most cases) from something that took a day or longer into something that was basically instantaneous. The fact is, while photography is a high art for a significant number of people, the masses wanted something simple that minimized the pain of taking photos—because they cared about the pictures more than the camera. They wanted something … well, disposable, that could “disappear” when they were done with it.</description>
