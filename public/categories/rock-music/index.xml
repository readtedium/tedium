      <description>[big]Gene Simmons, love him or hate him, has a history of trademarking very common things.[/big]
As any fan of the Scottish power-pop group Teenage Fanclub knows, the band’s label, Geffen, had to send a check to Simmons because the cover of the alternative rock band’s Bandwagonesque (which is a stellar album) featured a sack of money with a dollar sign on it—an image that Gene Simmons has long owned the trademark for, as it was the logo of his label, Simmons Records.</description>

[big]Today in Tedium: After Lemmy Kilmister of Motörhead died last month, tributes to the rocker were pretty easy to find—what couldn&amp;rsquo;t you say about this guy, who clearly played a massive role in the history of heavy metal?

[big]Today in Tedium: Today’s issue is dedicated to a troll named Brian Pee, who posted a mean petition on Change.org to discourage Phil Collins from his upcoming comeback attempt, only to end it when it started getting attention from the media. By the time he did, it had 4,352 signatures—and Pee was trying to laugh it off as a “silly joke” that had gotten out of hand. But before this guy fades into the ethers of dumb meme history, I have to interject here.</description>
