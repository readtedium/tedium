[big]Today in Tedium: We have a hard enough time wrapping our heads around a Pizza Hut or a Taco Bell, let alone a combination Pizza Hut and Taco Bell. But co-branding practices like this are often quite insane—and Yum Brands is far from the worst on this front. Recently, I passed by a Carvel ice cream stand at an airport that had integrated elements of a Nathan’s Famous hot dogs, an Arthur Treacher’s fish stand, and a Kenny Rogers Roasters chicken restaurant, all in the same tiny facility.</description>

      <description>[big]The other night, I took a bit of a swipe at McDonald’s for its poor track record in the Icelandic market. Ray Kroc and company, I apologize and admit that your sausage biscuits give me modest joy. After I write this piece, I may be forced to apologize again.[/big]
That’s because I’m about to bring up a bad memory for the fast-food giant.
In the late ‘80s, the World’s Fair was still a fairly Big Deal in North America, and Vancouver played host to one of the most notable World Expo galas, Expo ’86.</description>

[big]Today in Tedium: Getting people excited about fake mayonnaise is a challenge, but Hampton Creek Farms has admirably pulled off the task so far, convincing some that it had pulled off the impossible: replacing the egg in many every-day uses—particularly mayonnaise. But an article about the company in Business Insider last week implied that all was not well in the world of pseudo-mayo. The article suggested that the company stretched the truth about its primary products, that it tried to kill off a mandated severance package, and that it put a product on the market without knowing if it would spoil prematurely.</description>

[big]Today in Tedium: &amp;rdquo;You don&amp;rsquo;t have to go home, but you can&amp;rsquo;t stay here,&amp;rdquo; Grammy award-winning songwriter Dan Wilson frequently sings to the unwashed masses at many a college town bar around the country. (Fun fact: He won that Grammy not with Semisonic, but for writing a Dixie Chicks song.) And often, they don&amp;rsquo;t go home. Instead, they go to restaurants made for easing the next morning&amp;rsquo;s hangovers. Or they do go home, but then they order late-night food that gets delivered to dorm rooms so fast, they freak.</description>

[big]Today in Tedium: Alright, I&amp;rsquo;d like to do a quick survey. (This is optional, but it would be nice if you humored me.) OK, here goes: Step away from your computer for ten to fifteen seconds and look in your fridge, particularly the door area of the fridge. (Waits …) Do you have any sauce packets just sitting around? If so, how many, and where did they come from?</description>
