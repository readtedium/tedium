[big]Today in Tedium: Mitch Hedberg was a funny guy, and the main reason he was funny was because his one-liners were so on-point. Perhaps his best-known one involved the escalator. &amp;ldquo;An escalator can never break, it can only become stairs,&amp;rdquo; he famously joked. &amp;ldquo;You would never see an &amp;lsquo;Escalator Temporarily Out Of Order&amp;rsquo; sign, just &amp;lsquo;Escalator Temporarily Stairs. Sorry for the convenience. We apologize for the fact that you can still get up there.</description>
