[big]Today in Tedium: David Letterman is retiring soon, and while he didn&amp;rsquo;t invent the list, he probably did more to ensure its pop-culture legacy than anything _BuzzFeed_ could ever hope. Author and Death and Taxes editor-in-chief Brian Abrams, who wrote a book about Letterman&amp;rsquo;s NBC career last year, noted that the idea for Letterman&amp;rsquo;s Top Ten list came as a satire of the then-current obsession with lists in the mass media.</description>

[big]Today in Tedium: I&amp;rsquo;m writing these opening lines in Markdown, using a Mac app called Focused, one of many attempts to rethink the word processor as a minimalist exercise. Every one of my articles starts out in this app (or at least in John Gruber&amp;rsquo;s neglected gift to the world), and yet, I always find myself looking for another option, periodically launching into a Google deep dive that rarely leads to a better solution.</description>

      <description>[big]Of all the people it’s sucked to lose in 2017, Jerry Pournelle’s loss might quietly be the saddest.[/big]
Case in point: His final blog post, published Thursday. He noted the cold he was dealing with after attending a convention, wrote about immigration (Pournelle, an irreverent if hard-line conservative voice even at the height of his popularity, suggested that we let the “Dreamers” in after they serve seven years overseas in the military), and then overshared just a little bit before ending the post.</description>

Hey all, Ernie here with another slice of life from my pal David Buck. This time, he gives us the story of the Great American Motel Chain, and the man whose voice defines that story.
[big]Today in Tedium: You may recognize the voice of Tom Bodett as the whimsical narrator of those hilarious Motel 6 radio spots that have been floating around the airwaves for the past thirty years.</description>

[big]Today in Tedium: It seems like a constant refrain of the internet era–the robots are coming to steal our jobs, and they&amp;rsquo;re getting better by the day. So far, that has mostly meant that heavy industrial jobs have become increasingly automated and restaurants in San Francisco are basically making food without the added work of human hands. (And hey, if you think about it, vending machines are a very basic form of automation.</description>
