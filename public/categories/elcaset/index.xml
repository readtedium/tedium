      <description>[big]Start the tape: Roughly a year and a half ago, I made a pitch that we were due for a magnetic-tape comeback similar to the one we’ve seen for vinyl. (I titled it after a Frank Turner album, because Frank Turner is cool.) Now, we haven’t seen that magnetic-tape comeback just yet, but it might help if I did my part by highlighting tape-format obscurities.[/big]
One of those obscurities worth a mention is the Elcaset, just one of Sony’s many attempts to create a new standard of some kind.</description>
