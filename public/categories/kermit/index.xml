[big]Today in Tedium: The Muppets sure are awesome, aren’t they? We agree. Clearly, Jim Henson—a man who originally thought of himself more as filmmaker than puppeteer—was on an awesome kick when he came up with the idea to convince ad execs that anthropomorphic foam and rubber could be used to sell coffee. With something as long-lasting and popular as the Muppets, there&amp;rsquo;s a good chance it&amp;rsquo;ll take you in some weird directions—like Scientology, Hebrew, and fans willing to take the Muppet legacy into their own hands.</description>
