      <description>[big]On the grand scale of rock-band gimmicks, the move by The Shins to give away their old van to a deserving up-and-coming artist is pretty noble, despite the fact that, well, James Mercer is the only current member of the band that actually rode in it when it was in regular use.[/big]

The band, which is giving its freshly refurbished 1990 Ford 350 Clubwagon to the band that records the best cover of a song on the indie pop actâ€™s new album Heartworms, has the best intentions in mind for this van, which has probably seen a lot of big cities and small towns over the years.</description>
