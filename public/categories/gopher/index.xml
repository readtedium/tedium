[big]Today in Tedium: Every time I use pieces of the early internet, I get this warm feeling in my chest. It&amp;rsquo;s hard to describe, but I imagine it&amp;rsquo;s a feeling not unlike the feeling that went through the crowd during the Sex Pistols concert at Manchester&amp;rsquo;s Lesser Free Trade Hall on June 4, 1976. There&amp;rsquo;s a sense of purity and simplicity there that is hard to recapture through other meansâ€”the sense that I&amp;rsquo;m witnessing something culturally important that, in its own way, could change the world.</description>

[big]Today in Tedium: Here&amp;rsquo;s the thing about the internet that is striking from the position of a crate-digger: The crate never ends. It always keeps growing just a little bigger every single second. But that crate has a hole at the bottom. Stuff is falling out just as quickly, and pieces of history that would stick around in meatspace disappear in an instant online. So as a result, there aren&amp;rsquo;t a lot of websites from 1995 that made it through to the present day.</description>
