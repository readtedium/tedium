[big]Today in Tedium: Power outlets are frustrating, but the devices we use on a daily basis? They don&amp;rsquo;t necessarily make things easier.

[big]Today in Tedium: If you&amp;rsquo;re traveling away from home for any period of time, power outlets are a pretty good reminder that you&amp;rsquo;re not in Kansas anymore. Outlets vary wildly depending on the part of the world, and it&amp;rsquo;s a pain in the butt if all you want to do is plug in a device that you brought from one country to another. You will be frustrated, and there will be tears.</description>
