      <description>[big]Sorry, guys: The unofficial end of summer gets us no closer to the solution of the summer’s great mystery. Yes, that’s right, there was a big mystery hiding in the sand this summer—and it would’ve been a kickass discovery using any average metal detector.[/big]
Here’s the deal: Beachgoers in Westerly, Rhode Island have been confused as heck about a large metal object that was jutting out of the ground on the city’s beach.</description>

      <description>[big]A couple of months ago, I gave a little notice to Sega’s early attempt to tie cable connections with video games, the Sega Channel. Certainly, it was the most interesting communications-related experiment that Sega had formulated that year. But as it turns out, it was probably not Sega’s most interesting experiment involving communications. Far from it.[/big]
Now, to start off, Sega is famously a company that, during the Genesis/Mega Drive era at least, was not opposed to add-ons for this device.</description>

      <title>Otis Nixon, the CD-i, and Me</title>

      <description>*Editor&amp;rsquo;s note: Once I heard this story from my pal D. Frank Smith about America&amp;rsquo;s Team, the Atlanta Braves, and the worst console of a generation, I knew I had to share it with you guys. Enjoy!*
&amp;nbsp;
[big]“Is that Otis Nixon?” I asked my dad as we walked through an Atlanta mall in 1992.[/big]
It took a moment to adjust my eyes to reality, because Nixon was wearing a suit, not his traditional Atlanta Braves uniform, likely because he was doing an endorsement.</description>

[big]Today in Tedium: After Lemmy Kilmister of Motörhead died last month, tributes to the rocker were pretty easy to find—what couldn&amp;rsquo;t you say about this guy, who clearly played a massive role in the history of heavy metal? Perhaps the most curious and interesting tribute came from the world of retro gaming, where fans of Lemmy (a noted gamer) worked diligently to make an Amiga game based on Motörhead available to modern users.</description>

      <title>Seaweed: The Next Kale?</title>

      <description>[big]In Tuesday’s issue, I briefly noted how a Maine man was looking to revive straws made from rye—a practice that had fallen out of favor thanks to the invention of the paper straw.[/big]
It appears that rye straws aren’t the only unusual food-related item coming out of the Pine Tree State. Another entrepreneur, a guy named Josh Rogers, is attempting to make the case for tea made from seaweed.
“A lot of people don’t think it’s weird anymore,” Rogers told the Portland Press-Herald late last month.</description>

      <description>[big]Of the many strange niches one can find on YouTube, the most interesting might be that spearheaded by Jared Rydelek, a man who has gained some notice on YouTube for tracking down rare kinds of fruit to try out. His channel, Weird Explorer, features him mostly talking about the weird fruits he’s eaten over the years, often while traveling. (It’s a very specific niche.)[/big]
Clearly, this takes him a lot of strange directions, including in the direction of one of the most unusual-yet-common fruits you might find in the U.</description>

      <title>Things That Make You Go Hmmmm …</title>

      <description>[big]As early-‘90s dance music icons go, C+C Music Factory is no KLF, though in many ways, they’ve managed to hold onto a small smidgen of cultural relevance thanks to the 1990 dance-pop classic &amp;ldquo;Gonna Make You Sweat (Everybody Dance Now),” which at the time of release drew more notoriety for full-sized Martha Wash being hidden from the group’s music video—one of two videos where that took place that year.[/big]
These days, however, it’ll be known as the song that will get you fined by the Montreal police for yelling in your car.</description>
