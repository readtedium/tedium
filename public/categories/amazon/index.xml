      <description>Currently, it’s easier to get a nest-style bed for a Hatchimal than it is to get an actual Hatchimal.
Not that the buzzy toys may be worth it anyway, based on the class-action lawsuit filed against the toymaker Spin Master after the toy animals failed to hatch.
All of this makes me wonder whether we might be better off buying something else that hatches and hoping for the best.
Fortunately, it’s possible—and it’s a great workaround for a notable policy Amazon has against selling live animals in most cases.</description>

[big]Today in Tedium: From a historic perspective, one of the most intriguing things about technology is the way that so-called “category killers” often make us forget about what came before. There are all sorts of examples of this, including the one I wrote about just the other night. The iPad, case in point, somehow made everyone forget about decades of formative digital tablets in one fell swoop. Another example is the Amazon Kindle, a decade-old device that successfully created a formative industry around electronic books.</description>

      <description>[big]If you bought a pair of eclipse glasses from Amazon recently, you probably received a shock when the company informed you that it was selling solar eclipse glasses that weren’t certified to be used to watch the forthcoming eclipse—and that you would be getting a refund.[/big]
See, here’s what happened: A lot of major science and optical associations have been working with NASA on a campaign to ensure that people are buying glasses verified to be used during the solar eclipse happening in North America over the next few days.</description>
