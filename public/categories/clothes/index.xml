      <description>[big]As I learned a few months ago, creating custom T-shirts is a somewhat-complicated, but often quite useful way of promoting a product or raising money for an endeavor. That’s in part because it’s something that can’t effectively be done in the comfort of one’s home. [/big]
Screen-printing is a complicated process, embroidery moreso. You generally need specialized equipment, and the result of doing it at home is usually obvious—you can tell when a shirt was the product of an iron-on design.</description>

[big]Today in Tedium: Of the many appliances in our home that create byproducts, is there a more interesting byproduct than dryer lint? I don&amp;rsquo;t ask this to be facetious, nor to overplay its value, but to point out that there&amp;rsquo;s something inherently interesting about lint. It looks fluffy. It feels weird in your hands. And while it&amp;rsquo;s somewhat annoying to get rid of (and yes, you should get rid of it), it nonetheless is a novel object, one that&amp;rsquo;s more interesting and less disgusting than navel lint could ever claim to be.</description>

      <description>[big]When Amory Blaine decided to pack a T-shirt before heading to boarding school, he set in place a piece of literary history. Amory, the protagonist of F. Scott Fitzgerald’s This Side of Paradise, was the first literary character to use a T-shirt, ever.[/big]
“So early in September Amory, provided with ‘six suits summer underwear, six suits winter underwear, one sweater or T shirt, one jersey, one overcoat, winter, etc.,’ set out for New England, the land of schools,” the passage states.</description>

Hey all, Ernie here with another issue of Tedium by Andrew Egan. Last time he showed up on Tedium, he broke down NYC&amp;rsquo;s now-repealed dancing ban, and before that, he told us about professional cornhole. Now, he&amp;rsquo;s talking sweaters.
[big]Today in Tedium: Some simple inventions took a surprising amount of time to create. Case in point: The can opener was invented 45 years after the can. Reasons for these delays tended to result from technological gaps rather than a lack of Ingenuity.</description>

      <title>Why Aren&#39;t You Wearing Corduroy?</title>

[big]Today in Tedium: This newsletter/information feed is many things, but it’s not a fashion blog. We’re anything but fashionable. But we do have a tendency to follow trends to at least understand them, so when I saw on Refinery 29 today that “The Corduroy Comeback is in Full Swing,” I knew what was about to happen next in my life. I had to do a deep dive to understand this trend and understand why corduroy, of all fabrics, was important.</description>
