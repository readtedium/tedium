      <description>[big]It doesn’t get nearly as much attention as, say, 1992, but 1989 may have been the most interesting year for modern rock.[/big]
The reason for this was that the creation of Billboard’s Modern Rock Tracks chart the year prior created a context for people in the music industry who never would have had a chance at having a mainstream hit otherwise. And MTV, with its 120 Minutes franchise going strong, was ready to push the songs, too.</description>
