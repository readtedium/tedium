[big]Today in Tedium: Mitch Hedberg was a funny guy, and the main reason he was funny was because his one-liners were so on-point. Perhaps his best-known one involved the escalator. &amp;ldquo;An escalator can never break, it can only become stairs,&amp;rdquo; he famously joked. &amp;ldquo;You would never see an &amp;lsquo;Escalator Temporarily Out Of Order&amp;rsquo; sign, just &amp;lsquo;Escalator Temporarily Stairs. Sorry for the convenience. We apologize for the fact that you can still get up there.</description>

[big]Today in Tedium: If you break it down, life is but a series of constant ceremonies. Chicken dinners. Going to a place of worship (if you have one). Winning an award. Graduating from college. Birthday parties. Funerals. And of course, ceremonies to celebrate new structures, from buildings to bridges. Often, these events are celebrated in very specific ways that highlight ritual—if you’re graduating high school, you might wear a cap and mortar; if you’re turning 21, you might go to the bar.</description>
