      <description>[big]If a lottery system screws up, should the winners who benefited from that screwup win the prize they unwittingly earned?[/big]

But as it turns out, it was probably not Sega’s most interesting experiment involving communications. Far from it.[/big]
Now, to start off, Sega is famously a company that, during the Genesis/Mega Drive era at least, was not opposed to add-ons for this device.</description>
