      <description>[big]Utensils are the great equalizer. &amp;ldquo;I once saw a forklift lift a crate of forks, and it was way too literal for me,&amp;rdquo; late philosopher and one-liner king Mitch Hedberg apparently once said. It may be the deepest thing ever said about forks.[/big]
That&amp;rsquo;s because we generally don&amp;rsquo;t talk about forks very often, or utensils in general, really.
That&amp;rsquo;s despite their extreme prevalence. Everyone has to use a utensil at some point in their lives, whether they&amp;rsquo;re sporks, forks, spoons, or chopsticks.</description>
