      <description>Recently, I re-watched the movie Hugo, a truly dazzling 2011 Martin Scorsese film about a young boy who, in the process of running the clocks inside a 1930s-era train station, helps an old shop owner realize that he’s not a failure, but a living legend.
It’s a story, based on a book, that’s rooted in pure fantasy—I mean, obviously it’s unlikely that a young child could get away with the scheme suggested in the film—but Georges Méliès is a real guy, best known for his inventive early films, most notably A Trip to the Moon.</description>
