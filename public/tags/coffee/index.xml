[big]Today in Tedium: If you know anything about me, it&amp;rsquo;s that I&amp;rsquo;m a guy who likes his coffee—preferably simple, unadorned, and in most cases, iced. I wasn&amp;rsquo;t always such a coffee geek, Aeropressing my way through life as I Yelped places that sell nitro brews of roasted bean juice. But I&amp;rsquo;m in a reflective mood about it. The reason? This week, the man who founded the coffee shop that truly got me hooked—Elliot Juren, the namesake of Elliot&amp;rsquo;s Fair Grounds in Norfolk, Virginia—died after a long illness.</description>

      <description>[big]This sounds strange to think about, but when it comes down to it, there’s often a reason for everything, even if you’ve never even pondered it before.[/big]
Case in point: Have you ever wondered why traditional ceramic coffee cups, which are smooth around the edges, have that rough circular spot on the bottom? That was not a happy accident—it was a design choice.
See, that squat ceramic coffee cup, the one you’ve seen millions of times, in diners and living rooms, sometimes with brass-knuckle designs, came from somewhere—specifically Victor, New York, a town that initially made its name building porcelain insulators in the late 19th century.</description>
