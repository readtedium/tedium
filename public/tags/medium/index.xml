      <description>[big]Yesterday afternoon, I admit, was a bit rough. In a good way, but still rough. A piece from months ago by Andrew Egan, my regular contributor to the site, hit the Reddit front page completely unexpectedly, bringing my server to its knees.

Bump up the specs on the cloud server a little bit, change some server settings to make sure it&amp;rsquo;s working to the best of its abilities, and back in business.</description>
