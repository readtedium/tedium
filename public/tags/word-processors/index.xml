      <description>[big]When it comes to writing, I think that the biggest problem for a lot of people is properly organizing their ideas. There&amp;rsquo;s just so much to put into a document, and without well-considered organization, it can get a little long, jumbled, and overly ranty. (Overly ranty is bad.)[/big]
But that doesn&amp;rsquo;t necessarily mean that there isn&amp;rsquo;t room to rethink the approach. Perhaps you shouldn&amp;rsquo;t be writing in a totally linear format—perhaps you need to think in terms of a flow chart, one that is flexible to the whims of your prose.</description>

[big]Today in Tedium: I&amp;rsquo;m writing these opening lines in Markdown, using a Mac app called Focused, one of many attempts to rethink the word processor as a minimalist exercise. Every one of my articles starts out in this app (or at least in John Gruber&amp;rsquo;s neglected gift to the world), and yet, I always find myself looking for another option, periodically launching into a Google deep dive that rarely leads to a better solution.</description>

[big]Today in Tedium: Word processors are generally kind of boring—they do their job, and that&amp;rsquo;s about it. Most people don&amp;rsquo;t put a ton of second thought into their word processors. As you might have noticed from my rant from a couple of months ago, I&amp;rsquo;m not that kind of person. That rant drew up a lot of conversation, most of it good and interesting. (It did have its critics, but even their comments were interesting!</description>
