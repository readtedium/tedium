      <description>[big]When it comes to writing, I think that the biggest problem for a lot of people is properly organizing their ideas. There&amp;rsquo;s just so much to put into a document, and without well-considered organization, it can get a little long, jumbled, and overly ranty. (Overly ranty is bad.)[/big]
But that doesn&amp;rsquo;t necessarily mean that there isn&amp;rsquo;t room to rethink the approach. Perhaps you shouldn&amp;rsquo;t be writing in a totally linear format—perhaps you need to think in terms of a flow chart, one that is flexible to the whims of your prose.</description>

[big]Today in Tedium: As a writer, I know a lot of other writers, and I hear a common refrain among the writerly set—they have billions of tabs open, each with a potential new thing to read that they hope to get to someday, but might not ever see. The tabs bleed into one other, their icons shrinking in width and slowly becoming unclickable. I should be that person. I’m not.</description>

[big]Today in Tedium: From a distance, at least, there seems to be no rhyme or reason to the way we got our telephone numbers. And it’s becoming even less clear thanks to the increasing sophistication of the phone technologies we use. In particular, the layout of the area code system seems to have been picked at random, with no thought as to how the broader system should work. Or am I simply missing something bigger?</description>
