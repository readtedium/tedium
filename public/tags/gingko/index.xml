      <description>[big]When it comes to writing, I think that the biggest problem for a lot of people is properly organizing their ideas. There&amp;rsquo;s just so much to put into a document, and without well-considered organization, it can get a little long, jumbled, and overly ranty. (Overly ranty is bad.)[/big]
But that doesn&amp;rsquo;t necessarily mean that there isn&amp;rsquo;t room to rethink the approach. Perhaps you shouldn&amp;rsquo;t be writing in a totally linear formatâ€”perhaps you need to think in terms of a flow chart, one that is flexible to the whims of your prose.</description>
