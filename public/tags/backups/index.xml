[big]Today in Tedium: It&amp;rsquo;s deeply ironic that World Backup Day comes just a day before April Fools Day. One day encourages people to be stoic, serious, and overly cautious because people are inherently clumsy or devious; the other is designed to encourage people to throw caution in the wind because people are just Joshin&amp;rsquo; you. So in honor of both days (and in an effort to counter-program against all the stupid April Fool&amp;rsquo;s emails you&amp;rsquo;re probably going to be getting in the next 24 hours), let&amp;rsquo;s talk about the nature of destructionâ€”physical things that are valuable because they can&amp;rsquo;t be backed up, getting damaged, dinged up, or destroyed.</description>

[big]Today in Tedium: Hard drives may be the most fundamental building block of the computer revolution. Hitting the perfect balance between size and cost, it was a defining piece of computer history, one that made our machines more permanent and helped us rethink the way we store information. With a hard drive, we were eventually able to move away from the idea of thinking of our documents in terms of a linear order and a physical space.</description>
