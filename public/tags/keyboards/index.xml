Editor’s Note: Tonight’s Tedium is a piece of mine that recently ran in Motherboard_, a site that recently ran a cool piece on a counterfeit iPhone X. Enjoy!_

[big]Today in Tedium: Sometimes, cornering the market on a relatively niche idea is all a company needs to seal its fate as an enterprise that’s destined to stick around for the long haul. And you don’t get more relatively niche than the keyboard switch, as far as gadgets go.</description>

      <description>[big]Nearly a year ago, I bought a mechanical keyboard in an attempt to understand a phenomenon that I had been hearing about for a long time—the fact that many people really freaking love the heft of these old-style keys, which don’t get nearly as much love as they probably should.

[big]Today in Tedium: Of all the reasons for the video game crash of 1983, perhaps the most unappreciated might be the fact that computers were finally starting to gain a place in many households—and they could do a lot more than play games.
