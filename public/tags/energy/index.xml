[big]Today in Tedium: Power outlets are frustrating, but the devices we use on a daily basis? They don&amp;rsquo;t necessarily make things easier. In fact, the bricks that come with many modern devices, from your router to your Bluetooth speakers to your game console, tend to be giant, and at first, they were designed without any consideration for the fact that there was ample competition for your limited outlet space.</description>

[big]Today in Tedium: If you&amp;rsquo;re traveling away from home for any period of time, power outlets are a pretty good reminder that you&amp;rsquo;re not in Kansas anymore. Outlets vary wildly depending on the part of the world, and it&amp;rsquo;s a pain in the butt if all you want to do is plug in a device that you brought from one country to another. You will be frustrated, and there will be tears.</description>

[big]Today in Tedium: Salt is a great substance, and one that deserves an important place in our culture. But salt is also the most annoying substance on the planet, in that it makes nearly all of our water supply basically unusable for drinking purposes. Now, removing salt from water is not a painless process, but in an era when drought is a fact of life in places as far-flung as Australia and California, desalination is becoming an increasingly important process for increasing our freshwater supply by just a little bit.</description>
