[big]Today in Tedium: The Muppets sure are awesome, aren’t they? We agree. Clearly, Jim Henson—a man who originally thought of himself more as filmmaker than puppeteer—was on an awesome kick when he came up with the idea to convince ad execs that anthropomorphic foam and rubber could be used to sell coffee. With something as long-lasting and popular as the Muppets, there&amp;rsquo;s a good chance it&amp;rsquo;ll take you in some weird directions—like Scientology, Hebrew, and fans willing to take the Muppet legacy into their own hands.</description>

Hey all, Ernie here with a fresh piece from David Buck, who last came to you with a piece on DOS nostalgia. This time, he highlights the story of a guy who helped bring you the most recent season of MST3K, among other things.
[big]Today in Tedium: From the early days of civilization to modern day pop culture, puppetry has always been used to tell stories. What happens when you mix music, comedy and puppets?</description>
