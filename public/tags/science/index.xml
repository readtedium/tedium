[big]Today in Tedium: Did you hear the news? They&amp;rsquo;re taking the color out of Trix. The General Mills cereal is one of the most recent victims of a move towards more natural food, and in an effort to appease the suddenly health-conscious public, the company will be removing some of the artificial coloring from Trix and all of its other cereals. &amp;ldquo;We wanted to make sure they were still fun vibrant colors that we are providing and the fruity flavor that kids expect,&amp;rdquo; cereal developer Kate Gallager told Good Morning America of the move back in June.</description>
