[big]Today in Tedium: Napkins are something of a necessary evil of eating, especially in paper form. We need them to keep our fingers clean, but inevitably, they get thrown away. (Unlike straws, however, they naturally biodegrade, which is a point in their favor.) But as it turns out, the napkin is in trouble. People are apparently missing the long-term value of using these paper devices to clean their hands after they dive head-first into a burrito.</description>

[big]Today in Tedium: if you&amp;rsquo;ve been reading us for a while, you might notice a common theme in the pieces we send out to you guys. Often, our strangest issues take things common (but mundane), and discover a secret history hiding under your nose. From belly buttons to bandages to veggie burgers, no subject is too mundane for us. If you use it, there&amp;rsquo;s probably a great story as to how it got there.</description>
