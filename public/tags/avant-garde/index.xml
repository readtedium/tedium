[big]Today in Tedium: As well-loved as his productions were, iconic producer George Martin (not to be mistaken for this guy) didn&amp;rsquo;t bask in the glow of attention. For the most part, the iconic producer and arranger, who died this week at the age of 90, embraced his status as the man behind the boards, helping the Beatles create some of their greatest work.

[big]Today in Tedium: Of the many fascinating experiments on the internet these days involving red hot nickel balls, my personal favorite is this one, involving two guitars. This clip, apparently inspired by nickel-ball innovator Matthew Neuland&amp;rsquo;s uncle, at first attempted to show whether a fiery nickel ball would put the guitar out of tune. Then Neuland used the nickel ball to destroy the strings. It&amp;rsquo;s far from the first example of someone messing with guitar strings just to see what might happen—in fact, there&amp;rsquo;s something of a whole subgenre of guitar playing based on the concept of modifying or breaking guitars in unusual ways.</description>
