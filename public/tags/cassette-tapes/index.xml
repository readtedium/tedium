      <description>[big]Start the tape: Roughly a year and a half ago, I made a pitch that we were due for a magnetic-tape comeback similar to the one we’ve seen for vinyl. (I titled it after a Frank Turner album, because Frank Turner is cool.) Now, we haven’t seen that magnetic-tape comeback just yet, but it might help if I did my part by highlighting tape-format obscurities.[/big]
One of those obscurities worth a mention is the Elcaset, just one of Sony’s many attempts to create a new standard of some kind.</description>

[big]Today in Tedium: When&amp;rsquo;s the big comeback for magnetic tapes coming around, anyway? These days, vinyl is making a serious comeback with the public. Even Taylor Swift is selling a ton of vinyl records these days. But in a world where streaming and optical discs are more common than ever, the magnetic tape—which arguably has as much nostalgic hipster cachet as the vinyl record, and across a variety of formats at that—hasn&amp;rsquo;t seen nearly as much love.</description>
