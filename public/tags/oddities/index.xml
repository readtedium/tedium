[big]Today in Tedium: Here&amp;rsquo;s a tough problem. People love their cell phones, but the they hate the towers necessary to make those phones function. In fact, they really piss many people off, leading to situations where unnecessary fear-mongering wins the day, or leading people to worry that the towers will become eyesores that destroy their property values—or worse. So how do we get around the issue of these useful-but-ugly devices, anyway?</description>

      <description>[big]Perhaps you’ve seen them and assumed that you weren’t really good at taking the peel off the banana—the equivalent of banana lint. Perhaps you’ve eaten one, unsure of what it was, and wondered why it wasn’t as sweet as the rest of the banana.[/big]
I’m talking, of course, about the little string inside of the banana, which is often in the peel, but sometimes on the banana itself. It’s a curio that few people discuss for some reason.</description>
