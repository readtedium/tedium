Editor&amp;rsquo;s note: This is a special Wednesday morning issue, in an effort to get ahead of your holiday travel. We&amp;rsquo;ll be back to our normal Tuesday/Thursday schedule next week.
[big]Today in Tedium: Every year, I have a tradition that I&amp;rsquo;ve followed pretty religiously for more than a decade. Whether in its original form or in its Mystery Science Theater 3000 send-up, I&amp;rsquo;ll watch the junk-culture film Santa Claus Conquers the Martians, despite knowing that the movie is perhaps one of the worst of all time.</description>

Today in Tedium: 1995 was the year that Billy Corgan got in our faces and shouted, &amp;ldquo;Despite all my rage, I am still just a rat in a cage!&amp;rdquo; And since then, we&amp;rsquo;ve only gotten angrier as a society. All of our failings are tied to that inner rage that makes for good drama … but causes the most damage. Last week, uber-scientist Stephen Hawking called aggression &amp;ldquo;the human failing I would most like to correct.</description>

[big]Today in Tedium: Profanity is good for the soul. It encourages you to let out frustrations that might have driven you crazy, and (if used correctly) it might just help you win an argument. These reasons were probably front of mind for Willian Barboza, who wrote three profanities on the traffic ticket that the city of Liberty, New York gave him. (He also changed the town&amp;rsquo;s name to &amp;ldquo;Tyranny.</description>

[big]Today in Tedium: That sound you hear is Tipper Gore&amp;rsquo;s eyes bulging out. On June 1, a new video game called Hatred aims for the absolute edge of decency and taste, with a plot line that essentially involves killing innocent people en masse for no good reason other than to push forth the destruction of society. &amp;ldquo;We say ‘yes, it is a game about killing people’ and the only reason of the antagonist doing that sick stuff is his deep-rooted hatred,&amp;ldquo; its makers state.</description>
