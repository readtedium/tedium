[big]Today in Tedium: Last week, there was a tag on an item on my clothing that was so uncomfortable that there was nothing I wanted to do more than pull it off—to send that miserable tag to a recycling bin where it would never again see the light of day.

I had to do a deep dive to understand this trend and understand why corduroy, of all fabrics, was important.</description>
