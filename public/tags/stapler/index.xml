[big]Today in Tedium: If you’ve been reading my Twitter feed recently, beyond the jokes about old Stephen King aliases and sketchy emails from “Warren Buffett,” you’ll know that I spent a lot of my time recently getting acquainted with a stapler, as part of the now-completed production process with the Tedium zine. (Sorry if you missed it; I might do another zine later on, I’ll keep you posted.) I learned a lot about staples during this process: that you really need a special kind of stapler to do the kind of stapling I was doing real justice, and that Office Depot doesn’t sell that stapler for some reason shakes fist; that staples are brittle and break really easily; and that a guitar pick works in a pinch as a staple-flattener.</description>
