[big]Today in Tedium: Death is a weird thing. Everyone does it eventually (unless they’re immortal), and we don’t always have control over when it happens.

Here was a guy who started the internet era sporting a name that literally could not be searched, who forced lawsuits over barely-noticeable renditions of his songs in YouTube clips, and who made a lot of creative stuff that nobody will likely ever see.</description>
