[big]Today in Tedium: Customer support is a big frustration for the public. We want to be treated well, we want the human on the other end of the line to correctly pronounce our name, we want them to be friendly even when we&amp;rsquo;re not, and (most importantly) we want our problem solved. Most of the time, we&amp;rsquo;re lucky to get one of these things out of a customer support interaction.</description>
