[big]Today in Tedium: It’s often said about the current era of television that it’s an embarrassment of riches, one of the best eras of television of all time, in part because the floodgates have bumped up the quality quotient.

It’s weird to think about, but both cable TV and local syndication had a similar effect on television in the ’80s.</description>
