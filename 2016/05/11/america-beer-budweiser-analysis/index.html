  <strong>Today in Tedium:</strong> How arrogant do you have to be to name your product after an entire country, to assume that you&rsquo;ve earned that right? On Tuesday, the no-longer-American company Anheuser-Busch InBev announced that it was temporarily changing the name of its inexplicably popular beverage Budweiser to America, ahead of the 2016 election. &ldquo;It’s something that we could have not done overnight. If we’d launched Budweiser yesterday, as a new brand, we probably wouldn&rsquo;t have had the license to do it,&rdquo; Budweiser Vice President Ricardo Marques <a href="http://www.fastcodesign.com/3059681/budweiser-renames-its-beer-america">told <em>Fast Company</em>&rsquo;s design vertical</a>. &ldquo;The work of the past few decades allowed us to build this brand as a truly American brand.&rdquo; We&rsquo;re not convinced, so today, we&rsquo;re going to talk about things named after &ldquo;America,&rdquo; and whether those things earned the name. <em>— Ernie @ Tedium</em>

<p><em><strong>Editor&rsquo;s note:</strong> An earlier version of this post featured a history of American cheese. <a href="http://tedium.co/2017/07/04/american-cheese-culture-history/">That has been expanded into its own post</a>. I know you&rsquo;re psyched.</em></p>

<p><strong>— Dewey Bunnell,</strong> one of the three founding members of the folk-rock act America, <a href="http://www.marinij.com/article/ZZ/20080630/NEWS/806309959">discussing how the band&rsquo;s name</a> helped drive interest in the act. The band, known &ldquo;A Horse With No Name,&rdquo; &ldquo;Ventura Highway,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Sister Golden Hair,&rdquo; had an unusual starting point—the band, made up of American military brats who grew up in the U.K., <a href="http://www.latimes.com/local/obituaries/la-me-dan-peek-20110727-story.html">essentially picked its name</a> to prevent confusion when gigging in British pubs. Basically, they sounded American because they were actually American. But, as highlighted above, the name simply created more confusion later on. America wasn&rsquo;t the first band to come up with the idea of naming themselves after the country (<a href="http://www.allmusic.com/artist/the-united-states-of-america-mn0000920101/biography">the United States of America</a>, a wildly experimental band that had <a href="http://amzn.to/1OfYSo1">released a single album</a>, beat them to it by a couple of years), nor were they the last (<a href="http://www.presidentsrock.com/">the Presidents of the United States of America</a> had the right demeanor for their name).</p>

<h3 id="five-things-that-had-the-nerve-to-call-themselves-america">Five things that had the nerve to call themselves &ldquo;America&rdquo;</h3>

<ol>
<li><strong>Since 1909, Jesuits have published</strong> <a href="http://americamagazine.org/">a weekly newsmagazine called <em>America</em></a>, a fairly influential magazine that sometimes bucks the official stances of the Catholic Church.</li>
<li><strong>Comedian and currently bearded human being</strong> Jon Stewart&rsquo;s snarkily titled <em>America (The Book)</em>, <a href="http://amzn.to/1YkTaBI">released in 2005</a>, went for the gut punch: &ldquo;If the presidency is the head of the American body politic, Congress is its gastrointestinal tract,&rdquo; he wrote at one juncture.</li>
<li><strong>On the other end of the political spectrum,</strong> conservative commentator Dinesh D&rsquo;Souza&rsquo;s 2014 film <a href="http://amzn.to/1rFqXv6"><em>America: Imagine the World Without Her</em></a> attempted to make the case that the country&rsquo;s strong history was being threatened, but <a href="http://deadline.com/2014/07/dinesh-dsouza-america-google-missing-movie-showtimes-806191/">D&rsquo;Souza instead found himself fighting with Google</a> over the fact that he picked a title so broad that it was difficult to find showtimes for the film.</li>
<li><strong>In 2012, electronic musician Dan Deacon</strong> became only the latest tunesmith to name his album <em>America</em>. And like Stewart and D&rsquo;Souza, his reason for doing so was basically political. &ldquo;I’ve never had faith in government, but like it or not I’m in this system, and if I don’t actively try to do something about it, I’m part of the problem,&rdquo; <a href="http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2012-08-29/entertainment/chi-dan-deacon-interview-deacon-interviewed-about-america-20120829_1_dan-deacon-america-baltimore-club-scene">he told journalist Greg Kot</a>.</li>
<li><strong>There are a handful of towns</strong> that call themselves &ldquo;America,&rdquo; most notably the ghost town of America, Oklahoma. <a href="http://www.405magazine.com/July-2013/The-Rise-and-Fall-of-America-Oklahoma/">A 2013 piece in <em>405 Magazine</em> reveals</a> that the town was not named for the country, but the founder&rsquo;s wife, who happens to be named America.</li>
</ol>

</div>
<div class="md-redbox">

  <h3 id="1-008">1,008</h3>

</div>

<p><strong>The number of miles</strong> that the airship America traveled during a failed attempt to cross the Atlantic Ocean in 1910. It was the third failed effort by journalist and explorer Walter Wellman to complete a bold journey using the early aircraft. Just a few years after the Wright Brothers had invented the airplane, <a href="http://www.airships.net/first-attempt-fly-atlantic-wellman-vaniman-airship-america">Wellman got the crazy idea</a> to fly an airship over the North Pole. He made two separate attempts to cross over with the airship, but failed both times.</p>

</div>
<div class="md-graybox">
  <p><strong>If AB InBev were to actually register</strong> &ldquo;America&rdquo; as a trademark—something that legal experts <a href="http://www.latimes.com/la-fi-budweiser-america-trademark-20160510-snap-htmlstory.html">don&rsquo;t think could actually happen</a>—it wouldn&rsquo;t be the first time the &ldquo;America&rdquo; product mark has been registered, according to <a href="http://tmsearch.uspto.gov/">the U.S. Patent &amp; Trade Office</a>.</p>

<p>According to a search of the office&rsquo;s records, just 39 trademarks for the specific word exist, and most have been abandoned. One of the still-active ones is owned by Six Flags; another is owned by <em>America</em> magazine, the Jesuit publication I mentioned above.</p>

<p>But if you expand the search to basically include the word &ldquo;America&rdquo; as a single word in a longer phrase, suddenly the results grow to tens of thousands, with obscure brands like America&rsquo;s Socks and America&rsquo;s Favorite Flies, along with less-obscure ones like Hillary for America and, uh … &ldquo;Make Amerikkka Great Again.&rdquo; (The latter was notable enough <a href="http://www.worldipreview.com/news/make-amerikkka-great-again-trademark-application-filed-9984">that it earned some news coverage this week</a>.)</p>

<p>Mentioning such a broad topic like America makes people think of a lot of things, from politics, to art, to culture, and a million other things in-between. It is one of our most divisive words, in part because it means so much to so many—it brings together many, but for others, it&rsquo;s a symbol of unfulfilled promise.</p>

<p><img src="https://tedium.imgix.net/2018/01/mjqm2c71cqnoe4xs34sn.jpg" alt="Beer" /></p>

<p>Imagining one of the largest companies in the world trying to sell its most famous product as &ldquo;America&rdquo; invites some obvious cognitive dissonance.</p>

<p>Beer is great. I love beer. But is this specific beer worthy of being called &ldquo;America&rdquo;? I think not—it&rsquo;s too divisive, and raises too many questions for a country that can&rsquo;t even collectively decide whether to tie its shoes.</p>

<p>I argue that, when it comes to mass-produced items called &ldquo;America,&rdquo; we save it for the cheese. Pretty much everyone can agree on that.</p>
