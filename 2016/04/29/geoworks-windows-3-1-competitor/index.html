  <strong>Today in Tedium:</strong> Back in the early &lsquo;90s, it wasn&rsquo;t a sure thing that Microsoft Windows was going to take over the market, even though they had a clear lead over many of their competitors, thanks to MS-DOS. In fact, one of the iconic GUI-based experiences of the era, AOL, hedged its bets for a while, creating and maintaining a DOS version of its iconic pseudo-internet software using an GUI platform few were familiar with: GeoWorks. It was an operating system for an era when it wasn&rsquo;t even a sure thing we&rsquo;d have a modem. Today, we do a dive into the world of GEOS. It&rsquo;s a pretty weird place. <em>— Ernie @ Tedium</em>

What GEOS did show is that cheap, low-power, commodity hardware and simple office productivity software worked. You did not need a $2000 machine to type a simple letter and print it.”</h3>

<p><strong>— <em>OS News</em> writer Kroc Camen,</strong> discussing <a href="http://www.osnews.com/story/15223/GEOS_The_Graphical_Environment_Operating_System/">the early launch and success of GEOS (Graphical Environment Operating System)</a>, which started as an operating system option for the Commodore 64. The app, built by Berkeley Softworks—not to be confused with Berkeley Systems, which built <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcMJM04B-Co">the famous &ldquo;flying toasters&rdquo; screensaver</a>—was one of the most popular pieces of software on C64 for a time, thanks to the fact that it was very functional <a href="http://www.osnews.com/story/15223/GEOS_The_Graphical_Environment_Operating_System/page2/">and worked on very inexpensive hardware</a>. The operating system eventually moved to the PC in the early &lsquo;90s in a more advanced form, and Berkeley Softworks changed its name to GeoWorks.</p>

<h3 id="so-what-was-geoworks-like-anyway">So what was GeoWorks like, anyway?</h3>

<p>I had some experience with Commodore 64 thanks to a childhood friend of mine who owned one and let me mess around with it a bit, but ultimately, I caught onto the PC version of GeoWorks because it came bundled with a 386 I used when I was a kid.</p>

<p>That computer wasn&rsquo;t super-fast—what, with its 40-megabyte hard drive and one megabyte of RAM—and, as a result, it really benefited from the lightweight, object-oriented approach of GeoWorks. The operating system took up maybe 10 of those megabytes, tops. And in an era where connecting to the wider world wasn&rsquo;t really a big thing, the simplicity of the format was actually kind of nice.</p>

<p>Among the more interesting things about the platform:</p>

<p><img src="https://tedium.imgix.net/2018/01/gyxanh0qaedtinplo5bq.png" alt="GeoWorks startup screen" /></p>

<p><strong>Different interfaces for different skill levels:</strong> DOS was not a simple operating system for novices to jump into, and GeoWorks Ensemble made an effort to ensure it was more approachable. It offered two different tiers of usage—&rdquo;appliances&rdquo; and &ldquo;professional,&rdquo; along with a shell to jump into DOS programs, so you could play Commander Keen without a problem if you really wanted to. For people who had never used a PC before, the strategy was perfect—it had built-in training wheels.</p>

<p><img src="https://tedium.imgix.net/2018/01/thluylrudnmqlvxr4qx1.png" alt="GeoWrite" /></p>

<p><strong>Built-in office tools:</strong> The software included a variety of apps that were roughly comparable to anything you could find on other operating systems such as the Mac, including a word processor, calendar, and spreadsheet. It also included a Print Shop-style banner-maker, which came in handy if you owned a dot-matrix printer. Overall, these offerings were great for home users, an audience that Microsoft hadn&rsquo;t really emphasized early on in Windows&rsquo; history. It wasn&rsquo;t as flashy as, say, Microsoft Bob, but it worked a lot better.</p>

<p><img src="https://tedium.imgix.net/2018/01/fsxdng2je1mckb94b2cp.jpg" alt="386 computer" /></p>

<p><em>(<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/bossco/8678697129/">Raymond Shobe/Flickr</a>)</em></p>

<p><strong>Strong capabilities, low power:</strong> But the best part of GeoWorks was the fact that it worked well without really strong hardware. Windows 3.1 really needed a 486 to shine, but GeoWorks could effectively run on a 286 or 386 without any problem. It was stable, and despite the fact that (like early versions of Windows) it was essentially a graphical shell for DOS, it rarely ran into hiccups.</p>

<p>The software had a cult fanbase, especially among German computer users, who have done a lot to keep its memory alive.</p>

<p>So why did it fail? To put it simply, it had no apps. America Online was one of the only third-party developers it had—certainly a biggie, but not enough to sell a platform. Part of the reason for this was that, early on, you needed a Sun workstation to develop software for the platform, a deeply ironic requirement—essentially, you needed a $7,000 computer to develop software for low-end PCs, which meant mom-and-pop shops had no chance to even get on board. At the time, Microsoft was releasing Windows-native development platforms like Visual Basic to win over small developers.</p>

<p>But those things could have been dealt with, honestly, if the desktop operating system itself gained a significant audience. Even GeoWorks&rsquo; biggest fans knew it didn&rsquo;t stand a chance against Windows, due to Microsoft&rsquo;s already-established goodwill.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I feel badly that this truly amazing program will never be given a chance, as IBM and Microsoft would never allow it,&rdquo; <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=6UNWdidjDmIC&amp;pg=PT18&amp;lpg=PT18&amp;dq=geoworks+ensemble+%22third-party+developers%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=Xhuepjht0u&amp;sig=BRB4I20UwZDqQaAfN7vdKZb_H8g&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwifleSg7rLMAhUIYiYKHXL3BGcQ6AEIKzAC#v=onepage&amp;q=geoworks%20ensemble%20%22third-party%20developers%22&amp;f=false">one such fan wrote to <em>PC Magazine</em> in 1991</a>. &ldquo;I hope that software developers will see Ensemble&rsquo;s amazing potential and will begin developing it. Without third-party developers, Ensemble will never survive.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Microsoft was standing on the shoulders of giants. GeoWorks could barely even reach the ankles.</p>

Yet the software is advanced enough to satisfy experienced users of online services.”</h3>

</div>

<p><strong>—Steve Case, the executive vice president</strong> of Quantum Computer Services, discussing <a href="http://www.technologizer.com/2010/05/24/aol-anniversary/">the launch of the company&rsquo;s then-new dial-up service Promenade</a> in a 1990 press release. The software, which ran on a pre-release version of GeoWorks, was specifically set aside for IBM&rsquo;s PS/1 platform, which was one of the earliest computers to have a built-in modem by default. (Finding a version of Promenade in the wild is very difficult even for retro software sleuths, <a href="https://geekhack.org/index.php?topic=7417.15;wap2">as this lengthy message board thread highlights</a>, but here&rsquo;s <a href="http://www.broimg.de/pics/Mp6Ut91F2l3xMC05BH8B3CFVH.jpg">what it looks like</a>.) Within a year, the platform had been retooled into America Online (a company Case famously led throughout the &lsquo;90s), and within a decade, the company would be in the middle of <a href="http://www.wsj.com/articles/SB947493902515323558">an audacious merger with Time Warner</a>.</p>

<h3 id="geoworks-may-have-died-as-an-operating-system-but-it-had-a-number-of-extra-lives">GeoWorks may have died as an operating system, but it had a number of extra lives</h3>

<p><strong>One interesting thing about failed operating systems</strong> is that they often don&rsquo;t really die, but show up in random places because the software is still useful in certain cases. Palm&rsquo;s sadly-discarded webOS, for example, <a href="http://www.lg.com/uk/smarttv/webos">currently drives LG&rsquo;s smart televisions</a>.</p>

<p>GEOS was much the same way. Like a cow shoved through the food manufacturing process and split into a million pieces, parts of GEOS showed up in the ingredient lists of all sorts of weird products. Among the places where GEOS showed its bones:</p>

<p><img src="https://tedium.imgix.net/2018/01/cwxy8tbojzzc3is954vl.jpg" alt="Tandy Zoomer" /></p>

<p><strong>Personal digital assistants:</strong> Before Palm Computing founder Jeff Hawkins came up with the PalmPilot, he formulated an early take on the platform using a stripped-down version of GEOS. <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=2yYT_SOlHzAC&amp;pg=PA29&amp;lpg=PA29#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false">The Tandy Zoomer, which came out in 1993</a>, wasn&rsquo;t a hit, but the collaboration with GeoWorks, Tandy, and Casio proved informative for Hawkins and his team. It helped set the stage for the first truly successful PDA a few years later—one that <em>didn&rsquo;t</em> use GEOS. (Not to be outdone, Hewlett-Packard <a href="http://www.mgroeber.de/nathan/devices/ogo100.html">created a PDA using the platform itself</a>.)</p>

<p><img src="https://tedium.imgix.net/2018/01/ssqiee4sndcr4oxqpa5r.jpg" alt="Nokia 9000 Communicator" /></p>

<p><strong>Early smartphones:</strong> GEOS&rsquo; role in the mobile revolution wasn&rsquo;t limited to Palm. In the late &lsquo;90s, the operating system was a key part of the <a href="http://nokiamuseum.info/nokia-9000/">Nokia 9000 Communicator</a>, one of the earliest smartphones, and one that was well-loved. It was capable of basic word-processing, graphical web-browsing, and could even edit a spreadsheet. For those perks, it wasn&rsquo;t cheap, costing $800 at launch, and it was Zack Morris huge. &ldquo;Modern users take features like mobile email and web browsing for granted, but the Nokia 9000 Communicator was the first device to offer these in a single device,&rdquo; <a href="https://medium.com/people-gadgets/the-gadget-we-miss-the-nokia-9000-communicator-ef8e8c7047ae#.8cxnq5e1v">tech writer Richard Baguley wrote on Medium in 2013</a>. &ldquo;It may have been a bulky, clunky device, but we still miss it.&rdquo;</p>

<p><img src="https://tedium.imgix.net/2018/01/ri1g5evw1q8b5bpmn80a.jpg" alt="Brother Desktop Publisher" /></p>

<p><strong>Electronic typewriters:</strong> The &lsquo;90s were a bad time to be a typewriter-maker, and Brother was not well-positioned to handle the internet revolution. But it did have something up its sleeve: GEOS. The company <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!searchin/comp.os.geos/brother$20printer/comp.os.geos/MB9DHIDgOYM/rwDzb8VNwB8J">collaborated with GeoWorks on a set of printer variations</a> that added basic word processing and desktop publishing capabilities to the mix. They were still typewriters, but they did slightly more interesting things than write type.</p>

<p><img src="https://tedium.imgix.net/2018/01/yiq7efzqjbwxbi8tfmeh.jpg" alt="Brother GeoBook" /></p>

<p><strong>Primitive netbooks:</strong> Brother&rsquo;s interest in GEOS didn&rsquo;t just extend to typewriters; it saw GEOS as an opportunity to bring &ldquo;computing to the masses,&rdquo; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20050213134542/http://www.brother.com/us-release/internet.html">as one press release put it</a>. In 1998, years after GEOS had faded from view for just about everyone else, the typewriter company launched an alternative platform—the $500 GeoBook, a low-power laptop that predicted the rise of netbooks by about a decade. It could surf the web and had much of the software available in the DOS version of GeoWorks, but it didn&rsquo;t have a hard drive, which helped keep the price down. And much like netbooks, reviewers <em>hated</em> them. &ldquo;For the price of this unit, you can easily find a discontinued, refurbished or used Windows computer and maybe even a new one. It will do hundreds of things that this machine cannot dream of,&rdquo; <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/1998/05/26/science/personal-computers-even-at-600-geobook-is-no-bargain-notebook.html">a negative 1998 <em>New York Times</em> review explained</a>.</p>

<p>(In case you&rsquo;re curious what one of these is like, <a href="https://vintagegeek.wordpress.com/2017/04/21/brother-supernotebook-graphic-runs-geos/">here&rsquo;s a 2017 review</a>.)</p>

<p>There aren&rsquo;t any crazy GEOS projects like this nowadays that I&rsquo;m aware of, but hey, maybe it&rsquo;s running an ATM somewhere.</p>

</div>
<div class="md-graybox">
  <p><strong>So what&rsquo;s the deal with GeoWorks these days?</strong> Well, there&rsquo;s the tough part of this story. After the company dissolved in the late &lsquo;90s, the technology was sold off to a firm named NewDeal, which built an office suite out of GEOS, <a href="http://toastytech.com/guis/nd32.html">one that looked a lot like Windows 95</a> and took away a lot of the platform&rsquo;s unique charm.</p>

<p>At one point, the operating system was owned by Ted Turner&rsquo;s son, who attempted to run a low-cost PC company called MyTurn.com, with the GeoWorks software as its centerpiece. (When Teddy Turner ran for Congress in 2013, <a href="http://www.blufftontoday.com/bluffton-news/2013-03-13/turner-hits-back-negative-mailer-accusing-him-scamming-investors">his MyTurn.com days came back to haunt him</a>.)</p>

<p>Eventually, the operating system ended in the hands of a company called Breadbox, which had essentially treated GeoWorks as a volunteer upkeep project, with the eventual goal of turning the GEOS into an educational software platform <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160305164417/http://www.breadbox.com/products-tablet.php">that worked in tandem with Android</a>.</p>

<p>But recently, the company went into hibernation. In November, founder Frank S. Fischer died unexpectedly as they were in the midst of creating a version of the software for tablets.</p>

<p>John F. Howard, his longtime partner on Breadbox, is currently working on next steps, talking things over with Fischer&rsquo;s family as well as other developers who are interested in the platform.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There are still some legal issues to resolve, but I am confident that there is still some life in the GEOS code,&rdquo; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160422074455/http://www.breadbox.com/">he wrote on the Breadbox website last month</a>.</p>

<p>I recently fired up a version of GeoWorks on my MacBook Pro, using an installation of the emulator <a href="https://www.dosbox.com/">DosBox</a> to pull it off. It struck me as surprising how good the code for this thing still is. It wasn&rsquo;t easy to install—I was flipping the switch on an empty room, essentially—but when I got it working, I found the results impressive.</p>

<p>Compared to Windows 3.1, it was downright stylish—<a href="https://tedium.imgix.net/2018/01/v29fc0ztjpwezupfvtvl.png">just look at this preference screen</a>—and it deserved more of a shake than it got.</p>

<p>The odds against GeoWorks making a comeback are miles long, but let&rsquo;s hope the platform&rsquo;s flame gets a fresh spark one of these days.</p>
