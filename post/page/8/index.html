        Today in Tedium: More than 20 years ago, a reporter for The New Republic took a sharp stab at a famous conservative conference by implying nefarious activity that involved a minibar. “The minibar is open and empty little bottles of booze are scattered on the carpet,” the reporter wrote of the 1997 Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC). “On the bed, a Gideon Bible, used earlier in the night to resolve an argument, is open to Exodus.

        Tommy Wiseau, the legendary auteur of The Room, may not be a great filmmaker in the traditional sense, but he has a pretty enthused fanbase—a base of which I admit being a part of. And that fanbase, which has stuck with Wiseau through unusual projects like his 2015 Hulu series The Neighbors, has gotten a lot of mileage out of a single film that has owned the midnight movie circuit for years.

        Today in Tedium: In an era when digital storage is basically unlimited and space is running out by the second, there’s still a basic charm to physical objects that we’ve yet to really lose. Video games are a great example of this. Despite the fact that you can literally download any game under the sun and play it instantly, there is a quite healthy business online and elsewhere for physical product.

        Today in Tedium: The culture wars never really went away, but in an era when gun violence and online censorship are once again becoming hot topics in the news, now feels like a great time to discuss one of the greatest sources of controversy of the past 30 years—Married … With Children, an edge-busting TV sitcom that predated the Streisand Effect but may have been one of its earliest examples. And it all came about thanks to a Michigan homemaker with a few ties to a political dynasty.

        Today in Tedium: The tale of Ring, the startup that Amazon just acquired recently, is a fascinating one: An idea that got rejected on Shark Tank under a different name, the concept quickly found steam from new investors like the rapper Nas and became one of the most interesting forms of home automation, an industry that, according to Statista, is worth a cool $18.9 billion in 2018. But home automation had to start somewhere, and I’d like to argue that, barring any homes of the future, it really started gaining mainstream momentum with a device marketed by a guy perhaps better known for the Chia Pet.

    <h2 itemprop="about">Why the first “portable” computers, produced before integrated circuits, would really stretch the term today. Some portables needed a truck to move.</h2>
    
    <p class="content" itemprop="description">
        Today in Tedium: Portability is relative. When former Texas Instruments employees Rod Canion, Jim Harris and Bill Murto created a portable version of the IBM PC in 1982, it was a hulking device that weight 28 pounds and was roughly the size of a sewing machine. If you sold a desktop computer that weighed 28 pounds in 2018, you’d be laughed off the block. But the device, called the Compaq Portable, was revolutionary for its time and thrust the company that made it into the mainstream.

        Before Danny Elfman became the go-to guy for scoring great films, his band Oingo Boingo was a mid-&lsquo;80s go-to for soundtrack contributions. This ensured that, even as Elfman moved away from the band, Oingo Boingo would carry a massive pop-culture footprint.  &ldquo;I think Oingo&rsquo;s music is good for the audience for those films; the people will relate to it,&rdquo; Elfman said of the phenomenon, according to the Encyclopedia of Pop, Rock &amp; Soul.

Today in Tedium: If you’re a fan of director Tim Burton, you may recognize the name Danny Elfman. If you’re a Nightmare before Christmas fan, you may even recognize his voice. But, did you know he started his music career with a band called The Mystic Knights of the Oingo Boingo (later just Oingo Boingo)?
