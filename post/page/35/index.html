        Today in Tedium: Discovering new kinds of music is easier than ever, something we can credit Napster for—along with its later legal followers, particularly Spotify, Pandora, and Apple Music.

I think I realized that point during the early 2000s, when I found myself in the music section of a Barnes &amp; Noble store.

        Today in Tedium: Despite the name of this internet publication, I&rsquo;ve never mentioned what might perhaps be the most tedious part of the world&rsquo;s modern existence, the most basic of building blocks that connects every one of our devices, manufacturing processes, and likely even the chair you&rsquo;re sitting in right now: The screw. It strikes me that screws are the ultimate example of objects that hide under our noses that we never think about.

And how often is it that they stick around the market for 17 years, despite fairly limited public interest? Such is the case of WebTV, the set-top device that allowed you to surf a television-optimized version of the web. On September 18, 1996—20 years ago this week—a startup firm released a device that meant to bring the internet to the living room.

        Today in Tedium: If you grew up in the &lsquo;80s, you already you probably know this, but that decade&rsquo;s toy industry was a fascinating place. At this juncture, parents were already used to having to get batteries for their kids&rsquo; toys, and at the same time, primitive computing technology was just getting cheap enough that it could be integrated into those toys. Some companies, like Tiger Electronics, doubled down on the cheap silicon and thrived.

        Today in Tedium: Nine months ago, I made a lot of people mad for the dumbest reason. I criticized something that a lot of people surprisingly hold dear: Mattresses. Specifically, I pondered why the &ldquo;hipster mattress,&rdquo; as I controversially called it, had become such a prominent, widely advertised phenomenon online. People got grumpy. My rant briefly topped Hacker News. I was surprised. But not as surprised as I was when I stumbled across the airweave, a product whose selling point is that the mattress is mostly air supported by fancy fiber.

But Tiger Electronics did, and weirdly, it thrived just long enough for Hasbro to come in, scoop it up, and turn its Furby concept into a monstrous success during the 1998 holiday season.
