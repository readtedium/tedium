        Today in Tedium: We have a hard enough time wrapping our heads around a Pizza Hut or a Taco Bell, let alone a combination Pizza Hut and Taco Bell. But co-branding practices like this are often quite insane—and Yum Brands is far from the worst on this front. Recently, I passed by a Carvel ice cream stand at an airport that had integrated elements of a Nathan’s Famous hot dogs, an Arthur Treacher’s fish stand, and a Kenny Rogers Roasters chicken restaurant, all in the same tiny facility.

    <p class="content" itemprop="description">
        Last summer, I wrote an impassioned plea in favor of embracing the singular “they,” which I called “the Rodney Dangerfield of grammar.”  Basically, this word use, which has no simple singular equivalent that doesn’t dive into awkward gender politics when the subject’s grammar hasn’t been revealed, has been written around for hundreds of years by newspapers and in other formalized grammar settings. The Associated Press, notably, had resisted changing its mind on this issue, even as the linguistic tide started to favor it.

        Today in Tedium: We live in a world where facial recognition has become so sophisticated that we’re being forced to ask very serious ethical questions about it. (In the U.S., the depth of the FBI’s facial-recognition capabilities are raising some serious questions from Congress. In China, it’s being used to detect toilet paper theft. To each country their own.) But I want to take a step back from the big hairy ethical questions and consider how we started on this road—with typography.

Can you build a brand while working around one of the oldest sites on the internet? The answer appears to be yes.  Since 1994, a guy named Jeff Abrahamson has run the website Purple.com, a domain name which lives up to its name—the site features a deep, rich hue of purple (originally #DD00FF, now #7D26CD), a link to an FAQ page, and an offer to advertise in a very minimal way.

Unboxer extraordinaire Lamarr Wilson, for example, was so freaked out by this cup that he took a baseball bat to it. (That did the trick, by the way.

        Dial-up modems were underpowered enough back in the days of AOL, but at the height of their popularity, manufacturers figured out a way to make them even worse.  During the late ‘90s, a spate of companies, including big name modem manufacturers like U.S. Robotics, Motorola, and PCtel, had the idea to replace hardware-based modems, which generally required a separate digital signal processor to manage the dial-up connection, with software-based equivalents, which took this task and put it on top of the CPU already being used.

        Today in Tedium: When the Beatles took their earliest U.S. tours, the limitations of the concert infrastructure at the time showed themselves in a big way. Put simply, you couldn’t actually hear the band over the screaming teenagers—a problem so difficult to solve that it took 40 years for technology to advance to the point where it made their only official live album, released in 1977, listenable. Eventually, this led to the creation of better sound systems for all the bands that came after them.

        You know what’s a terrible racket? Printer ink. Driven up by artificial markets and complex, incompatible cartridge systems, printers have become one of the most depressing parts of any computing experience—especially if you own one at home.

Hewlett-Packard last year had a scandal on its hands after it added digital rights management to its printers, then turned it off after people complained.
