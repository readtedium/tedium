        I&rsquo;m not a very good cook, though I&rsquo;ve gotten better over the years.

Problem was, the joke was on me.

I write stuff that is driven on research. It’s an important part of what I do. That research takes me weird places—into patent filings, reading news stories that are decades old, diving into snippets of old books, hoping that something—anything—will get me closer to the end of the story.

        Today in Tedium: The history of computing is full of stories that follow a specific arc, or a slight variation on it. Here’s the gist: A company has massive success, dominating an entire era of computing. They, understandably, get big in their britches, and fail to consider that their technology may not always be the greatest thing since sliced bread. First, they go into slow decline, then leadership problems pile up and the slow decline happens fast.

    <p class="content" itemprop="description">
        Recently, I re-watched the movie Hugo, a truly dazzling 2011 Martin Scorsese film about a young boy who, in the process of running the clocks inside a 1930s-era train station, helps an old shop owner realize that he’s not a failure, but a living legend.
It’s a story, based on a book, that’s rooted in pure fantasy—I mean, obviously it’s unlikely that a young child could get away with the scheme suggested in the film—but Georges Méliès is a real guy, best known for his inventive early films, most notably A Trip to the Moon.

        Throughout his entire 15-year playing career, NBA legend Rick Barry was a man without shame.  He won a lot of accolades for his play, and was a massively successful star. But he won that success, strangely, by using a style of shot that most people throw out before they reach middle school. See, Barry was an underhand free-throw shooter, and it worked really well for him: For every 10 free throw shots he attempted during his career in the ABA and NBA, he made about nine of them, a rate that was extremely impressive for its time.

        Currently, it’s easier to get a nest-style bed for a Hatchimal than it is to get an actual Hatchimal.
Not that the buzzy toys may be worth it anyway, based on the class-action lawsuit filed against the toymaker Spin Master after the toy animals failed to hatch.
All of this makes me wonder whether we might be better off buying something else that hatches and hoping for the best.
Fortunately, it’s possible—and it’s a great workaround for a notable policy Amazon has against selling live animals in most cases.
