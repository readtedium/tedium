    <p class="content" itemprop="description">
        Today in Tedium: Courtroom drama may be one of our greatest televised resources. Reality-based shows that take place in a courtroom—of the actual kind, the high concept kind, and the heavily plotted kind—have proven one of the easiest ways to draw a consistent audience since television entered American lives in the 1950s. Last week, two things happened that highlighted this: The trial of former NFL player Aaron Hernandez, who was found guilty of first-degree murder charges; and, more colorfully, the discovery that political strategist James Carville last year made a pilot for a court show of his own.

        Today in Tedium: Late rock legend Lou Reed has been in the news lately for a somewhat odd reason. On Monday, Reed&rsquo;s sister wrote about her brother&rsquo;s medical situation during his teenage years—when, the rumor goes, his parents had him undergo electroshock therapy to fend off homosexual urges. (Lou did undergo the controversial therapy treatment, but his sister denies that latent homosexuality was the cause. Speaking of their parents, she explains: &ldquo;They were caught in a bewildering web of guilt, fear, and poor psychiatric care.

In fact, if you actually knew something about logo design, you might be disappointed by Rand&rsquo;s campaign logo. (It&rsquo;s better than Hillary&rsquo;s, we&rsquo;ll give him that.

        Today in Tedium: The problem with giving anyone on the street the right to review a restaurant is that he or she can easily be influenced by the wider political or social climate in setting their review score.

Gertrude Weaver barely even had a chance to celebrate her newfound reign as the world&rsquo;s oldest woman—she died a mere five days after the title changed hands, at age 116. (Up next is Michigan woman Jeralean Talley.

        Today in Tedium: This weekend marks the opening day of the 2015 season of Major League Baseball—a sport that you find either immensely fascinating or overrated compared to more action-packed sports like football or basketball. Baseball has never completely lost the public&rsquo;s fascination, though it&rsquo;s certainly had some rough periods over the years. And sometimes, the fans can be total jerks. Today&rsquo;s issue of Tedium covers what it&rsquo;s like to be in the midst of a crowd of annoying baseball fans.

        Today in Tedium: Talk about the ultimate after-school job: Back in 1979, an Ottawa television station decided to create a children&rsquo;s television show basically because they were contractually obligated to as part of an agreement with the Canadian government. Their solution to this problem was to create a sketch comedy show, hiring local teenagers, nearly all of whom had no acting experience, to recreate the magic of _Monty Python_ and Saturday Night Live, without a matching budget.

The bulb, which the department calls &ldquo;The Centennial Bulb,&rdquo; has only been shut off a few times in its history, and remains working to this day essentially because they go out of their way to never turn the light bulb off.

Developers, without knowing your name or your circumstances, would curse you under your breath, because your clicking on their website made their job harder.
