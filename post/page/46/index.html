        Today in Tedium: For kids of a certain age, the Game Genie was a life-changer. Literally. It could change the number of lives you had in whatever cartridge you put it on, as well as do a bunch of other crazy things to the game you were playing. It provided a thrill that we&rsquo;ve kinda gotten away from as video games have grown more complex, but the device leaves behind a rich legacy.

        Today in Tedium: Vending machines are one of the few things keeping us away from the dream of a cashless society. The devices, which offer up an array of items for a little bit of pocket change, are silent but prevalent. They represent some of our most technologically advanced furniture, and they&rsquo;ll probably always be there for us in our time of need. Today&rsquo;s Tedium discusses their history—along with why, for some reason, they make us want to steal stuff.

        Today in Tedium: If you&rsquo;re watching the right digital substation, the message is hard to ignore. Ron Paul says we&rsquo;re facing a catastrophic financial crisis that could leave you screwed. That&rsquo;s a weird message to hear from any former politician, even one with the libertarian bonafides of Ron Paul. (His son Rand must be psyched that this is how he&rsquo;s spending his retirement.) But the paid ads, which are designed to get you to buy some financial services you don&rsquo;t need, nonetheless offer a funhouse mirror from which to consider the market forces that cause currency to lose its value.

        Today in Tedium: Rich people care about their grass way more than normal people do. Now, rarely is this an issue, but in recent months, the ongoing California drought has made this mundane issue a political one. This week, the city of Rancho Santa Fe became a target of this culture clash after _The Washington Post_ highlighted the water-rationing requirement it soon faces. Local residents aren&rsquo;t happy. “When we bought, we didn’t plan on getting a place that looks like we’re living in an African savanna,” said conservative radio host and local resident Steve Yuhas.

        Today in Tedium: Yesterday, a coworker and good friend of mine revealed to me a fact that made me feel very old.

I was taken aback by this news—I thought everyone knew what Columbia House was! The mail-order CD service (along with its competitor BMG) had a bright moment in the early &lsquo;90s, only to see its business model fall apart thanks to iTunes, and later, Spotify.

        Today in Tedium: The payment card as we know it is both more popular than ever and, well, dying. According to a 2013 Federal Reserve study, the number of credit card payments in the United States passed the number of check-based payments for the first time, and debit cards passed that mark way back in 2004. But the magnetic swipe isn&rsquo;t long for this world—the industry is switching to a chip-based system this year, and mobile payments threaten to put cards out to pasture soon after that.

They&rsquo;re historic memes, but they never seem to have any attached history.
