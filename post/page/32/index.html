        Today in Tedium: Of the many things that we lost in 2016, one of the saddest losses might have been a purely cultural one. At the end of 2016, the Carnegie Deli, an iconic slice of New York City, served its last overstuffed, overpriced pastrami sandwich. (That’s despite an on-the-table, quickly rebuffed offer from a New York restaurateur to buy out the owners for $10 million.) The Jewish deli will survive—Katz’s is still with us, for one thing—but it’s still a bummer.

        Behind the Mask: It takes a certain kind of human being to create a persona for yourself, and—by all accounts—Chris Sievey was very much that person.  The British musician made his name in the ‘80s with an oddball comic persona named Frank Sidebottom, who was noted for both the giant mask he wore and his ability to rewrite classic pop songs into comic odes about Frank’s hometown, the Manchester suburb of Timperley.

        Testing 1, 2, 3: Two years ago, Tedium got its start based on what I like to call the &ldquo;difficult second album&rdquo; theory. &ldquo;The cliche that you have a lifetime to make your first album and only a year or two to make your second holds true,&rdquo; The Guardian&rsquo;s Dorian Lynskey wrote back in 2003 of this basic concept, in the context of The Strokes, whose second album wasn&rsquo;t actually all that difficult.

        Today in Tedium: Let’s go back in time about 20 years, to two days after Christmas, 1996. On this day, as I was becoming accustomed to Bush’s second album, millions of families around the United States were unpacking and setting up their first home computers. For those who skipped the Commodore and Apple II eras, who didn’t have a Videotex installed in their televisions, and had no idea who Commander Keen even was, this was the moment in time when they joined the internet revolution, brandishing their their AOL or Hotmail addresses for all the world to see.

Well … someone read Evernote’s policy and found out that they were going to let engineers have access to user notes in an anonymized fashion. That didn’t go over well, even after a defense by the company’s CEO.

Today in Tedium: This is my third Tedium piece in as many months. Though previous articles placed figures on World War II tourism in Germany or the danger of a relatively new aerial sport, the revelations offered in this piece were the most ardently cautioned against by sources. One, who will go unnamed, practically begged me not to write about this while others reacted to the news by slowly sucking air through clenched teeth.
