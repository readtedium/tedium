    <h2 itemprop="about">There are lots more weird phone numbers out there—and some of them have pretty fascinating stories. Read on to learn more about the vintage phone system.</h2>
    
    <p class="content" itemprop="description">
        Today in Tedium: Almost exactly a year ago, we wrote up a lengthy piece on weird telephone numbers. This piece has been a sleeper hit of sorts in Tedium history. Many of our pieces, if they do gain steam, tend to pick up within a week of writing. Not this one. Instead, the piece went to the top of Google for dozens of variations on the search term “weird phone numbers,” “creepy phone numbers,” and so on.

    <p class="content" itemprop="description">
        You may or may not have noticed this, but Tedium relies pretty heavily on archival content to exist. This newsletter and publication is not just about offering up weird facts: It&rsquo;s often about introducing facts that have otherwise been forgotten about by the public at large.  Sometimes, this takes me in some interesting directions. An example I regularly cite is my piece on lemon juice squeeze bottles. It was the rare piece I had the chance to mostly write ahead of time, and while there were some incredibly useful starting points on the issue from the Beach Packaging Design, I find it important that, even if an existing resource like this offers a starting point, I spend time doing some digging of my own.

        Today in Tedium: Every time I use pieces of the early internet, I get this warm feeling in my chest. It&rsquo;s hard to describe, but I imagine it&rsquo;s a feeling not unlike the feeling that went through the crowd during the Sex Pistols concert at Manchester&rsquo;s Lesser Free Trade Hall on June 4, 1976. There&rsquo;s a sense of purity and simplicity there that is hard to recapture through other means—the sense that I&rsquo;m witnessing something culturally important that, in its own way, could change the world.

    <p class="content" itemprop="description">
        In the past couple of weeks, a bit of DuckTales-mania has hit the internet in a way that could best be described as giddy-ing. It’s understandable. It’s not every day Disney gives the fans what they want—and it ’s not every day that the results of that are pretty amazing.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EURi91Eb6I8
And it’s worth that level of nostalgia, because it’s reviving what perhaps was the most important cartoon of the ‘80s—both culturally and from an economic standpoint.

        When it comes to writing, I think that the biggest problem for a lot of people is properly organizing their ideas. There&rsquo;s just so much to put into a document, and without well-considered organization, it can get a little long, jumbled, and overly ranty. (Overly ranty is bad.)  But that doesn&rsquo;t necessarily mean that there isn&rsquo;t room to rethink the approach. Perhaps you shouldn&rsquo;t be writing in a totally linear format—perhaps you need to think in terms of a flow chart, one that is flexible to the whims of your prose.

    <p class="content" itemprop="description">
        Today in Tedium: In our 4K-televised world, in which things (usually) look good at 120 frames per second, it’s strange to think back to points in our history where the graphics weren’t nearly that good—where the visuals took something of a backseat to the graphics getting pumped out. But it wasn’t all that long ago when our graphics were crude, blocky, and very limited in resolution. And part of the reason for this can be pointed at IBM, which prioritized text over imagery on its early PCs, all in an effort to win over business users.

        Gene Simmons, love him or hate him, has a history of trademarking very common things.  As any fan of the Scottish power-pop group Teenage Fanclub knows, the band’s label, Geffen, had to send a check to Simmons because the cover of the alternative rock band’s Bandwagonesque (which is a stellar album) featured a sack of money with a dollar sign on it—an image that Gene Simmons has long owned the trademark for, as it was the logo of his label, Simmons Records.

        Today in Tedium: For centuries, the average home had windows, but not necessarily glass covering those windows—in part, because glass was really expensive at first, and the flat pane variety that we’re used to didn’t exist at first. But as glass evolved as part of the modern home, it suddenly became important to keep those panes of glass clean. And that meant there was an opportunity for a manufacturer to come about and make it easy.

        No surprise to anyone, but large countries have this way of splaying out all over the world, with lots of their territories in unexpected areas.
