    <h2 itemprop="about">Jim Gaffigan jokes aside, Hot Pockets made a family of expat Iranian Jews into billionaires—billionaires who have jumped into philanthropy with both feet.</h2>
    
    <p class="content" itemprop="description">
        Today in Tedium: Laugh all you want, but Hot Pockets are the ultimate modern food. Incredibly easy to eat and simple to cook, they cleverly were designed to be easy to microwave and completely, utterly portable. Less known about the Hot Pocket, however, is its origins, which are the product of a duo of Iranian-born Jewish immigrants who arguably popularized the concept of microwavable frozen meals. Jim Gaffigan hates these things, but we admit something of a respect for them as a bottom-up success story (that just happens to be incredibly unhealthy).

    <p class="content" itemprop="description">
        Today in Tedium: Here&rsquo;s a challenge for you: Take your favorite video game of the &lsquo;90s and don&rsquo;t think about it in terms of the quality of the game, its graphical quality, or its replayability—especially if it&rsquo;s a game based on an existing license. Instead, think of that game in terms of it merely being a vessel to market another product: say, a movie like Terminator 2, a toy like a Barbie doll, or a musical act like Aerosmith.

    <p class="content" itemprop="description">
        Today in Tedium: Of the many fascinating experiments on the internet these days involving red hot nickel balls, my personal favorite is this one, involving two guitars. This clip, apparently inspired by nickel-ball innovator Matthew Neuland&rsquo;s uncle, at first attempted to show whether a fiery nickel ball would put the guitar out of tune. Then Neuland used the nickel ball to destroy the strings. It&rsquo;s far from the first example of someone messing with guitar strings just to see what might happen—in fact, there&rsquo;s something of a whole subgenre of guitar playing based on the concept of modifying or breaking guitars in unusual ways.

        Today in Tedium: People make mistakes often. We&rsquo;re human. We&rsquo;re fallible. It&rsquo;s the thing that most easily proves that we&rsquo;re not robotic. See, if a bot makes a mistake, it&rsquo;s ten to one because a human programmed it incorrectly. And honestly, those errors aren&rsquo;t necessarily bad things. We make mistakes every day, bounce back from them and are significantly more amazing as a result. They make us more human, more creative, and allow us to test what our limits are.

        Today in Tedium: For decades, television owners haven&rsquo;t been content with simply embracing the options already in front of them. There are lots of tales of this nature throughout TV history—from the people who owned (or in some cases, built) massive satellite dishes so they could pick up obscure television signals from other parts of the world, to the public-access weirdos who have long created their own kinds of television (some of whom got really lucky), to the people who got obsessed with the Amiga in the &lsquo;90s.

If we’d launched Budweiser yesterday, as a new brand, we probably wouldn&rsquo;t have had the license to do it,&rdquo; Budweiser Vice President Ricardo Marques told Fast Company&rsquo;s design vertical.

The &lsquo;zine movement was perhaps at its peak during this time, proving an important way to democratize content for the average person.

In this age of absurd analytics, Twitter nontroversies, and over-the-top digital campaigns, it seems insane that a yard sign could have any effect on most people, especially for large-scale presidential campaigns. For one thing, compared to tweets and social media platforms, such signs are not cheap. And they only show logos! There are no policy statements to be found anywhere on these signs.

In fact, one of the iconic GUI-based experiences of the era, AOL, hedged its bets for a while, creating and maintaining a DOS version of its iconic pseudo-internet software using an GUI platform few were familiar with: GeoWorks.
