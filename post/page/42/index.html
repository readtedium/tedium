        Today in Tedium: Last week, the journalists at the Las Vegas Review-Journal had a problem: Their newspaper had a new owner, but they couldn&rsquo;t figure out who the hell it was. After roughly a week of reporting, they finally figured out exactly who spent $140 million on the paper—one Sheldon Adelson, the casino owner and major Republican donor—but it wasn&rsquo;t easy to get quite that far. Thanks to the law, there was nothing requiring the owner to come forward and reveal themselves to the public.

        Today in Tedium: Those stupid hoverboards that have shown up just about everywhere lately have a big problem, and its name is lithium.

        Today in Tedium: As we were putting the finishing touches on last Thursday&rsquo;s Tedium, a terrible bit of news hit the internet—the death of Scott Weiland, one of the most influential rock vocalists of the last quarter-century. Weiland&rsquo;s death, for many, was not a surprise, and that fact was touched upon by his former band, Stone Temple Pilots. In 2013, Weiland was kicked out of the band he helped make famous, leading to a lengthy legal battle between the two sides.

        Today in Tedium: These days, it seems like TV is all about gimmicks: Think reality shows, TV shows that recap the TV shows that literally just aired, limited series designed to recycle old hit shows, and even live theatre productions like The Wiz. TV executives are like P.T. Barnum-style hucksters, willing to try anything to keep us watching. And it&rsquo;s always been that way, honestly—if they can make watching your boob tube into an &ldquo;event,&rdquo; they know they&rsquo;ve sucked you in.

        Today in Tedium: If you&rsquo;ve had a chance to ride on Interstate 180 in Cheyenne, Wyoming, you might have noticed something strange about the road. Despite being called an &ldquo;interstate,&rdquo; which implies a certain set of rules about what the road should look like, it doesn&rsquo;t look anything like a freeway. In fact, it&rsquo;s the only interstate highway in the continental United States that doesn&rsquo;t meet federal standards for being an interstate highway.

        Today in Tedium: In their own quiet ways, spelling and grammar are each forms of lobbying. Language is one of the few facts of everyday life that started out as a variety of opinions on what things should be called. And those opinions, like a diamond pressed into form, slowly molded into a definitive shape. But there&rsquo;s a limit to how much we&rsquo;re OK with as a society—hence the popularity of dictionaries and style guides, which draw up a map for how we use words on a daily basis.

Odds are that if you live in a state north of the Mason-Dixon line, you&rsquo;ve probably seen a dead leaf or two on the dirty ground.

        Today in Tedium: Today’s issue is dedicated to a troll named Brian Pee, who posted a mean petition on Change.org to discourage Phil Collins from his upcoming comeback attempt, only to end it when it started getting attention from the media. By the time he did, it had 4,352 signatures—and Pee was trying to laugh it off as a “silly joke” that had gotten out of hand. But before this guy fades into the ethers of dumb meme history, I have to interject here.
