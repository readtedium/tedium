        Today in Tedium: Before software, purchases generally worked like this: You walked into a store, you bought a physical object, and that object was yours until it became damaged or outdated, and you threw it out. But software, being much smaller in physical space than any commercial object that came before it, wasn&rsquo;t limited by these rules. Data came in bits and bytes, and could be dripped out or distributed in any number of ways.

Today in Tedium: Risk is a part of everyday life. Even basic tasks, such as commuting to work or eating, involve a minimal amount of danger. Yet some people prefer activities that involve an inordinate amount of risk.

        Editor’s note: Today’s issue is created in partnership with the folks at Make Room, a nonpartisan organization sponsored by the housing nonprofit Enterprise Community Partners.
Today in Tedium: There’s a lot of country hiding between New York and San Francisco, but for some reason, these two cities dominate discussions about rent prices in the United States. It’s understandable. It’s pretty easy for your eyes to pop when you read about a 1-bedroom apartment’s price topping $3,500, as ApartmentList reported about San Francisco earlier this month.

        Today in Tedium: For the past 20 years, a familiar trend has exposed itself with the turn of every U.S. presidential election cycle: Each one is ever-slightly more defined (heck, even redefined) by technology, particularly online trends that have come along in the three years prior. In 1996, it was a coming-out party for the web. In 2000, the growth of online news began to have an impact on how we researched candidates.

    <p class="content" itemprop="description">
        Today in Tedium: The big-box technology store isn&rsquo;t dead yet—and in the case of Best Buy, it&rsquo;s actually doing pretty well, beating financial estimates by a country mile. But as a whole, the concept of the sprawling electronics chain is far from its peak. In fact, it&rsquo;s sort of another shade of the office-supply store. Despite that, investors keep trying to revive this idea. Right now, an investor named Ronny Shmoel is trying to bring Circuit City back to life as a physical presence, roughly seven years after the brand was mothballed.

But there&rsquo;s plenty of reason that we should. The biggest is this: Sometimes, hiding in that terrible taste might be something so important that it can change the world in a noticeable way.

        Today in Tedium: You may not like meat, but even if you do, you may not think of it in terms of innovation. It sounds like a concept incompatible with the idea of meat—we do so many things with cows, chicken, fish, and pigs that it&rsquo;s difficult to consider these animals in terms of reinvention. We&rsquo;ve already mashed these four types of animals into combinations more creative than Legos, taken their parts and turned them into products that don&rsquo;t even fit into the same genre as dinner.
