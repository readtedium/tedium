    <h2 itemprop="about">In the &#39;80s and &#39;90s, advertisers got the idea to market products to kids through video games. The games aren&#39;t half-bad (mostly), but they&#39;re still ads.</h2>
    
    <p class="content" itemprop="description">
        Hey guys, Ernie here with a piece from the Tedium archives about Madison Avenue’s infiltration of classic video games, which is legitimately a thing that happened.
Today in Tedium: Here&rsquo;s a challenge for you: Take your favorite video game of the &lsquo;90s and don&rsquo;t think about it in terms of the quality of the game, its graphical quality, or its replayability—especially if it&rsquo;s a game based on an existing license. Instead, think of that game in terms of it merely being a vessel to market another product: say, a movie like Terminator 2, a toy like a Barbie doll, or a musical act like Aerosmith.

    <p class="content" itemprop="description">
        Today in Tedium: For a wide variety of reasons, Sears has been a company creaking its way through modern times for longer than many of the people reading this have even been alive. It was a fundamental company to the American revolution—while it didn’t invent the mail-order catalog, it made it a successful business and set the stage for decades of followers. But I don’t want to wallow in Sears’ failings; there are plenty of other outlets for that.

(Instead, its fast decline took about a year, even with a high burn rate, and now the company is changing its model because it has no other choice.

        On a day when the news is utterly saturated with stories about a famous YouTube user getting blocked from the service, I’d like to spend some time writing about another YouTube user who was blocked from the service today.  You don’t know him, but you’ve likely seen the videos he uploaded—because news sites linked those videos pretty religiously.
The user, named “consumer,” played a small but important role in the YouTube ecosystem.

Or, if you’re really smart, you’ll hoard them in your bag or pocket—each one with a different logo—without even realizing it.

        On April 3, 2000, one of the most prominent companies of the 21st century was born. That day, the name and logo for Verizon became known to the masses. The company, for better or worse, became a defining middleman, fundamental to the way we use our phones and access our internet.  The next day, a popular rock band released a physical single for what would become their biggest hit. “Everything You Want,” a song from Vertical Horizon&rsquo;s first major label record, had already been on the radio for a few months by this point.

        Today in Tedium: It took us about a hundred years to turn film processing (in most cases) from something that took a day or longer into something that was basically instantaneous.

They wanted something … well, disposable, that could “disappear” when they were done with it.

        Today in Tedium: It’s often said about the current era of television that it’s an embarrassment of riches, one of the best eras of television of all time, in part because the floodgates have bumped up the quality quotient. Netflix creates so much stuff (some great, much average) that we’re unaware of nearly all of it! It’s weird to think about, but both cable TV and local syndication had a similar effect on television in the ’80s.
