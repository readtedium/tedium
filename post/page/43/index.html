        Today in Tedium: The TV network ABC Family is a family network in the loosest of senses. For years, it&rsquo;s mostly focused on one particular element of that family—the older teens and young adults that make up the massive wave of millennials that appeal so much to advertisers. In fact, the term &ldquo;Family&rdquo; barely made sense—which is why the network decided recently to change its name to Freeform, a change that takes effect early next year.

        Today in Tedium: True story—over the weekend, a restaurant attempted to suggest that I had a fake ID. The ID was a few years old, granted, and it has a small crack in it, but it nonetheless was a real form of identification. The waiter made a joke along the lines of the ID looking like a fake ID he used in college, which seemed like a bad joke until a few minutes later, when the manager came out and asked to look at it.

        Today in Tedium: You probably don’t need to read it from me to know that homeowners associations are pretty much the worst thing ever to happen to neighborhoods, but in case you need more evidence, 11-year-old Sara Marston has plenty. Marston found out recently that a popular Halloween display in her neighborhood wouldn’t go up this year due to a set of restrictions specifically targeting that house. She put up an online petition, hoping she would get 100 supporters.

In fact, it didn&rsquo;t technically have a name at all. If you bought the record on vinyl, it was called Album; if you bought it on CD, it was called Compact Disc.

Sorry for the convenience. We apologize for the fact that you can still get up there.

        Today in Tedium: I’ve decided that I’m a big fan of Swiss army knives. Not the knives themselves, necessarily—I can never properly finagle my nails to pull the blades out of the casing—but the idea behind them. A single object with numerous uses is an incredibly powerful idea, and one that the Swiss Army Knife got to first. Something about this simple, elegant concept gets lost somewhere in a Bed Bath and Beyond run, probably because multi-tools probably cut away at their stuff-laden businesses.

    <p class="content" itemprop="description">
        Today in Tedium: In 1971, advocates for recycling had a big breakthrough in the state of Oregon. The state became the first in the United States to require a deposit on bottled beverages sold within its borders. Suddenly, lazy people had a financially fruitful excuse to return bottles to their local stores—because if they did, they could make a little money. Since then, however, the diminishing returns of the nickel—the financial reward for recycling a can or bottle in most states that followed suit—has led to a dip in those taking part in the program.
