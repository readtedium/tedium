    <h2 itemprop="about">Listening to 87.7 FM? That&#39;s not a radio station, but an old analog TV station—channel 6, to be exact. It&#39;s a total fluke, but Chicago&#39;s all over it.</h2>
    
    <p class="content" itemprop="description">
        Today in Tedium: TV on the Radio isn&rsquo;t just the name of a really freaking good band. Instead, it&rsquo;s a quirk of the design of analog television. But a funny thing happened on the way to obscurity: As analog TV gave way to digital, a handful of risk-taking broadcasters, sensing an opportunity, have started to run those analog TV stations as FM radio stations—big FCC plans be damned. The shift is surprisingly contentious in the world of broadcast.

    <h2 itemprop="about">For more than 100 years, the cool breezes of air conditioning have taken hold around the world. It took us about as long to even consider the side effects.</h2>
    
    <p class="content" itemprop="description">
        Today in Tedium: The 1902 invention of air conditioning has long been hailed as one of the most important inventions of the 20th century, one that has forever changed the way we live. But as we hit an era when robots become more human than ever and try to steal our jobs, I find myself wondering—what can we learn from the additional freedom that air conditioning gave us? Sure, it improved our society by making temperature something that we can control, but what about the problems that came with this cool breeze?

    <h2 itemprop="about">The film Independence Day is known for an epic scene in which the White House is turned into small chunks of America. How did they do that?</h2>
    
    <p class="content" itemprop="description">
        Today in Tedium: It was an explosion that only the aliens saw coming. Almost exactly 20 years ago, the film Independence Day hit theaters and featured perhaps the single most iconic visual effect of the 1990s—a short, but effective shot of The White House getting destroyed by a gigantic alien mothership. The scene is memorable for a lot of reasons, one of which is that it looked pretty realistic. If you&rsquo;re like me, you probably are wondering: How did they get that set to look so, uh, White House-y?

        Today in Tedium: When I see people complaining about the images and links shared through the &ldquo;content discovery&rdquo; platform Taboola and its cousin Outbrain—something I admittedly have been known to do—I inevitably find myself drawn to the &ldquo;taboo&rdquo; part of the Israeli company&rsquo;s name. Because, if you think about it, it&rsquo;s a really good descriptor of the images you see adding noise to nearly every large site on the internet. They show ways of life and images you wish didn&rsquo;t exist—images of stuff that shouldn&rsquo;t exist, if there was a God.

    <p class="content" itemprop="description">
        Today in Tedium: It took a while for us to culturally admit it, but video games are a form of art on the level of many films—and that means that game developers are very much auteurs in the way that film directors are. (Or, depending on the game, schlockmeisters.) But as anyone who has ever used a Game Genie could tell you, there are things that developers don&rsquo;t want you to see, at a basic level far removed from a mere easter egg.

For some, simply having access to a couple of fonts outside of what you could get with a typewriter was enough; for others, it was less about creating an impressive design and more about creating a design that was a step above what you could do with a pen and paper.
