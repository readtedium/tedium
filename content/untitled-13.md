To start off, here's a note from Aaron Cunningham, who has been supporting Tedium for nearly a year:

> My wife Amber has an anxiety disorder that makes it difficult for her to fall asleep at night.  We found that me reading aloud to her in bed is enough to help her fall asleep, but then the question became: what to read?  We needed something lighthearted and not too dark, written about "dull" topics that lend themselves well to bedtime reading, but also interesting enough that we both enjoy the articles.
> 
> We eventually came across Atlas Obscura, but quickly found that the articles we loved most all had your name in the byline.  It didn't take long before we just came directly to Tedium: starting with the oldest articles first, we're now up to October 2017.  We've been readers for over a year now—she's typically out after the first five minutes, while I find myself finishing entire articles (and often re-reading sections to stretch them across multiple nights).
> 
> We're more than happy to support your Patreon, and receiving a random item from you every month is icing on the cake!  So thanks for writing!  We really enjoy it!

### “Tedium combines the best of the 99% Invisible podcast and James Burke's Connections TV show. It takes the invisible and makes it visible again and then connects it to the past and present creating a livelier picture than you ever knew existed.”
