      <description>On a day when the news is utterly saturated with stories about a famous YouTube user getting blocked from the service, I’d like to spend some time writing about another YouTube user who was blocked from the service today.

The user, named “consumer,” played a small but important role in the YouTube ecosystem.</description>
