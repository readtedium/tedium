      <description>I have to admit, I kind of loved the idea of launching this site with a slab-serif font. Slab-serifs, with their hard edges and consistent widths, have a lot of character, and I&amp;rsquo;ve always loved the feel that they&amp;rsquo;ve given my work over the years. I loved using them when I still designed newspapers, and I love using them now. A while back, I found a good one, and it has treated me well—both at Tedium, and the last iteration of my old site ShortFormBlog.</description>

      <description>Today in Tedium: We live in a world where facial recognition has become so sophisticated that we’re being forced to ask very serious ethical questions about it. (In the U.S., the depth of the FBI’s facial-recognition capabilities are raising some serious questions from Congress. In China, it’s being used to detect toilet paper theft. To each country their own.) But I want to take a step back from the big hairy ethical questions and consider how we started on this road—with typography.</description>

      <description>the thing with uppercase letters is that if they aren’t there, you start to miss them after a while. they tend to carry a certain weight about them, one that speaks to a certain authority.
(IT’S AN AUTHORITY LOST WHEN EVERY SINGLE LETTER IS UPPERCASE.)
recently, this became an issue for the students of Quinnipiac university, because their school decided to change its logo without uppercasing the u.
angry petitions were filed, and complaints on social media followed.</description>
