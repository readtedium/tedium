      <description>Hey guys, Ernie here with another piece from Andrew Egan that ponders the details of American independence. Why do we celebrate it exactly this way? I’ll let him take it away.
Today in Tedium: America is still a fairly young country, but old enough to have traditions we don’t question. The World Series, hot dogs, and brutal, drawn out political campaigns are great examples. But as Americans fire up their barbecues and toss some beer into the cooler, it’s worth taking a closer look at one of America’s greatest traditions.</description>

      <description>Today in Tedium: It was an explosion that only the aliens saw coming. Almost exactly 20 years ago, the film Independence Day hit theaters and featured perhaps the single most iconic visual effect of the 1990s—a short, but effective shot of The White House getting destroyed by a gigantic alien mothership. The scene is memorable for a lot of reasons, one of which is that it looked pretty realistic. If you&amp;rsquo;re like me, you probably are wondering: How did they get that set to look so, uh, White House-y?</description>
