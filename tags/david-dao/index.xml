      <description>Today in Tedium: We’re near the start of the new year, and, as a result, I’m closing in on the third anniversary of launching this crazy newsletter. New Year’s Day is kind of an important day for me personally, as it’s the day that I’ve launched two of my projects, including this one. So I’d like to spend this time reflecting back a little bit … and looking forward. I write about a lot of obscurities and a lot of unusual histories with Tedium, but sometimes, it’s good to ponder the here and now in the framing of this newsletter.</description>
