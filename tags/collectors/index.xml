      <description>Hey all, Ernie here with a recent piece of mine that also showed up in Motherboard. In case you haven&amp;rsquo;t read it yet, it&amp;rsquo;s a good one and highlights both SGI and the the excellent community IRIX.cc. Read on, and hope you dig!
Today in Tedium: Recently, I was faced with an unusual question about a piece of hardware that very few people have ever used. The question: What makes a giant workstation, one that once cost as much as a house when it was first produced in the early â€˜90s and makes as much noise as a vacuum, so appealing to a 16-year-old?</description>

      <description>Today in Tedium: Here&amp;rsquo;s something you probably don&amp;rsquo;t know about me. For a couple years in the late-&amp;lsquo;90s and early 2000s, I got my sea legs in writing from a little site called Zophar&amp;rsquo;s Domain, a console emulation enthusiast site. At the time, ZD held a kind of legendary status among retro gamers, and though it&amp;rsquo;s aged some, it&amp;rsquo;s still around. (Here&amp;rsquo;s what it looked like when I was there.) I&amp;rsquo;m not really much of a gamer anymore, but this stuff still holds a place in my heart.</description>
