      <description>Today in Tedium: If you&amp;rsquo;re watching the right digital substation, the message is hard to ignore. Ron Paul says we&amp;rsquo;re facing a catastrophic financial crisis that could leave you screwed. That&amp;rsquo;s a weird message to hear from any former politician, even one with the libertarian bonafides of Ron Paul. (His son Rand must be psyched that this is how he&amp;rsquo;s spending his retirement.) But the paid ads, which are designed to get you to buy some financial services you don&amp;rsquo;t need, nonetheless offer a funhouse mirror from which to consider the market forces that cause currency to lose its value.</description>

      <description>Today in Tedium: It&amp;rsquo;s the oldest scam in the book, and people fall for it all the freaking time. Pyramid schemes of all shapes and sizes have been bilking people out of their hard-earned money for generations, and you&amp;rsquo;re probably gonna get screwed out of your hard-earned money before you even realize it. Today&amp;rsquo;s Tedium is all about scams that leave scars way deeper than all the money stolen. — Ernie @ Tedium</description>
