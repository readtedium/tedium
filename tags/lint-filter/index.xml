      <description>Today in Tedium: Of the many appliances in our home that create byproducts, is there a more interesting byproduct than dryer lint? I don&amp;rsquo;t ask this to be facetious, nor to overplay its value, but to point out that there&amp;rsquo;s something inherently interesting about lint. It looks fluffy. It feels weird in your hands. And while it&amp;rsquo;s somewhat annoying to get rid of (and yes, you should get rid of it), it nonetheless is a novel object, one that&amp;rsquo;s more interesting and less disgusting than navel lint could ever claim to be.</description>
