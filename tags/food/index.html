    <p class="content" itemprop="description">
        Today in Tedium: Have you heard the good news? Frozen food is back, baby! After years on the sidelines, Healthy Choice is seen as a healthy choice again; people looking to put on a home banquet are looking towards Banquet; hungry men are choosing Hungry Man. The future is frozen, and if you’re not warming up to cold foods, you’re not cool. With tonight’s Tedium, I’d like to focus on one specific kind of food put on ice, the frozen pizza, and why it’s become an icon of prepared American food.

    <h2 itemprop="about">The story of Beer Nuts, the alcohol-accompanying brand of nuts that you’ve probably seen in a sitcom bar somewhere.</h2>
    
    <p class="content" itemprop="description">
        If you’re a certain age or tend to watch TV shows from a certain time, you might remember the ubiquity of the humble beer nut. Almost any sitcom in the ’80s or early ’90s that involves a bar will mention beer nuts at some point. Here’s Norm Peterson using beer nuts in a clunky analogy about women:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weBbZ11d5LM
And of course, there are the mandatory Simpsons references, such as when Homer buys “Kwik-E-Mart No Name Brand Beer Nuts” or when a fake beer nuts can is spring loaded with snakes.

        Today in Tedium: There have been many instances in my life that I’ve been told I’m a sauce obsessive. Maybe I pour a little too much A1 on a steak, a too-aggressive dip of a fry into a side of ranch dressing, a little too much salsa on the side of an omelet. I’m sure if I ran into Gordon Ramsay somewhere and he saw how much sauce I used, he would scold me.

        Today in Tedium: If one was forced by the twisting of the arm to choose one item to get rid of on their Thanksgiving plate on Thursday, some people might choose turkey (mostly the vegetarians), and some others might choose cranberries (which aren’t hip anymore), but I promise you nobody—and I mean nobody—would choose the mashed potatoes. They are the glue of our thanksgiving meal, the most essential element, the only thing that must be served in some form.

        Honestly, it makes no sense why a company best known for manufacturing tires is such an important voice in the world of fine dining, but Michelin has embraced its gastronomic role with gusto for more than a century.  Now, it turns out that one of its most-decorated chefs isn’t feeling that gusto himself. Sébastien Bras, a French chef whose restaurant Le Suquet has been a three-star mainstay of the Michelin guide for close to two decades, made the first-ever request to be removed from the guide without a significant change to his model.

I’m talking, of course, about the little string inside of the banana, which is often in the peel, but sometimes on the banana itself. It’s a curio that few people discuss for some reason.

Another entrepreneur, a guy named Josh Rogers, is attempting to make the case for tea made from seaweed.

        As I highlighted recently, Amtrak trains are rife with delays—which can be blamed on a combination of failing infrastructure and a lack of track ownership.  We can’t solve the problem of Amtrak very easily, but pizza is a pretty nice salve.
On Sunday, a mechanical failure knocked out a train on the way to Washington from New York City, eventually leading passengers to have to switch trains. While they were stuck waiting in the Wilmington, Delaware, area, someone stuck on the underfunded transit medium got the idea to call a local pizza place for nourishment.
