      <description>Recently, I had a reader send me a zip file full of old ideas I had for a website I worked on nearly 20 years ago. It was an unusual bit of digital archaeology, in part because I didn’t actually remember the project until after I had seen the end results. Then, it all came back to me—a revival of ideas, good and bad, the reflection that I’ve been building sites like the one I&amp;rsquo;m typing on now since before I was even in college.</description>

      <description>Today in Tedium: Earlier this week, I got a little grumpy over at Product Hunt, due to an undercurrent of snark around the fact that Netflix still has a DVD service. The reason for this was that too many people were skeptical about whether such a service was still necessary. It absolutely, totally is, and I’ll give you one reason why: Netflix’s DVD service has roughly 93,000 options, while its streaming service (between shows and movies) has fewer than 8,000 options—ensuring that DVDs will have a reason to exist for quite a while.</description>
