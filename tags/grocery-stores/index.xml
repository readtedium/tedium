      <description>Today in Tedium: Have you heard the good news? Frozen food is back, baby! After years on the sidelines, Healthy Choice is seen as a healthy choice again; people looking to put on a home banquet are looking towards Banquet; hungry men are choosing Hungry Man. The future is frozen, and if you’re not warming up to cold foods, you’re not cool. With tonight’s Tedium, I’d like to focus on one specific kind of food put on ice, the frozen pizza, and why it’s become an icon of prepared American food.</description>

      <description>Today in Tedium: While I don&amp;rsquo;t hold the simple, evocative opinions of small-town life that John Mellencamp does—I think large cities are pretty cool, and I&amp;rsquo;m not sure where I&amp;rsquo;ll die yet—I do appreciate the fact that they exist. But let&amp;rsquo;s be clear: On a competitiveness front, they&amp;rsquo;re at a sheer disadvantage compared to large cities with a much larger reach, more options, and more people. As a result of this, good luck finding a vegan bakery in a small town.</description>

      <title>You Don&#39;t Win Friends With Salad</title>

      <description>Today in Tedium: Last month, a major lobbying group for the school lunch industry won a victory that involved salad bars. The School Nutrition Association, feeling the pressure because of what it called arduous nutrition rules, fought for (and won) a slightly more reasonable policy, including rules that specifically allowed schools to continue to offer salad bars to those super-grubby, messy kids. Some local health inspectors tried to veto the salad bars, claiming they created health hazards.</description>

      <title>I&#39;d Buy That for a Dollar</title>

      <description>Today in Tedium: The dollar store is one of capitalism&amp;rsquo;s greatest gifts to itself, if you think about it. Here&amp;rsquo;s a business model that has, quite brilliantly, taken advantage of the ebbs and flows of supply and demand. It turns products that don&amp;rsquo;t cost a lot to produce into things that actually make money hand over fist, despite the seemingly tight margins. Like companies that turn the liquidation of products into a viable business model and the makers of generic products, dollar stores have their place in the pantheon of retail.</description>

      <title>Identifying a Real Fake</title>

      <description>Today in Tedium: True story—over the weekend, a restaurant attempted to suggest that I had a fake ID. The ID was a few years old, granted, and it has a small crack in it, but it nonetheless was a real form of identification. The waiter made a joke along the lines of the ID looking like a fake ID he used in college, which seemed like a bad joke until a few minutes later, when the manager came out and asked to look at it.</description>

      <title>Bottles and Cans and Just Clap Your Hands</title>
      <link>/2015/09/18/bottle-deposit-recycling/</link>

      <description>Today in Tedium: In 1971, advocates for recycling had a big breakthrough in the state of Oregon. The state became the first in the United States to require a deposit on bottled beverages sold within its borders. Suddenly, lazy people had a financially fruitful excuse to return bottles to their local stores—because if they did, they could make a little money. Since then, however, the diminishing returns of the nickel—the financial reward for recycling a can or bottle in most states that followed suit—has led to a dip in those taking part in the program.</description>
