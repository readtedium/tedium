      <description>Today in Tedium: Last year, a consumer advocate showed up in the most unlikely place: On YouTube, the home of the no-questions-asked unboxing channel. Cody Crouch, aka iTwe4kz, reviewed a set of earbuds from a company called Kanoa. In a Nike hat and a Puma sleeveless shirt, Crouch (who was clearly frustrated) trashed the earbuds at length and questioned the behavior of the company that was banking on him to give a good review.</description>

      <title>The Internet&#39;s First Election</title>

      <description>Today in Tedium: For the past 20 years, a familiar trend has exposed itself with the turn of every U.S. presidential election cycle: Each one is ever-slightly more defined (heck, even redefined) by technology, particularly online trends that have come along in the three years prior. In 1996, it was a coming-out party for the web. In 2000, the growth of online news began to have an impact on how we researched candidates.</description>

      <title>Let’s Destroy the White House … Again</title>

      <description>Today in Tedium: It was an explosion that only the aliens saw coming. Almost exactly 20 years ago, the film Independence Day hit theaters and featured perhaps the single most iconic visual effect of the 1990s—a short, but effective shot of The White House getting destroyed by a gigantic alien mothership. The scene is memorable for a lot of reasons, one of which is that it looked pretty realistic. If you&amp;rsquo;re like me, you probably are wondering: How did they get that set to look so, uh, White House-y?</description>

      <title>Stop Stealing My Sign</title>

      <description>Today in Tedium: Today&amp;rsquo;s issue of Tedium is all about politics—but not in any way you might assume. In this age of absurd analytics, Twitter nontroversies, and over-the-top digital campaigns, it seems insane that a yard sign could have any effect on most people, especially for large-scale presidential campaigns. For one thing, compared to tweets and social media platforms, such signs are not cheap. And they only show logos! There are no policy statements to be found anywhere on these signs.</description>

      <title>Jack Abramoff, Film Producer</title>
      <link>/2016/04/08/jack-abramoff-film-producer/</link>

      <description>Today in Tedium: No matter how many redemption tours he goes on, Jack Abramoff remains an infamous name in political circles. In the mid-2000s, he was the man at the center of a wide array of lobbying scandals, sometimes involving obscure parts of the United States like the Northern Mariana Islands and Guam. A decade ago this month, Abramoff was planning for a prison stay, having just been sentenced in a fraud case involving a casino cruise line.</description>

      <description>Today in Tedium: In the age of the internet, it&amp;rsquo;s easier than ever to get one&amp;rsquo;s hand on information that touches the very edge of the First Amendment&amp;rsquo;s limits. (We are by no means recommending you do that. Stick to Disney.com.) But before that, if you wanted to tell someone how to make a bomb in the kitchen of your mom—as an al-Qaeda magazine once infamously put it—it came down to literature.</description>

      <title>Who Keeps the Metric System Down? We Do</title>

      <description>Today in Tedium: Yesterday, Lincoln Chafee decided to end his presidential campaign before it even started. His way of ensuring nobody takes him seriously? He made a pitch for the metric system. “Let’s be bold. Let’s join the rest of the world and go metric,” he said during his introductory speech. Yeah, yeah, everyone uses the metric system elsewhere, but this is goddamn America and we like our cars on the right side of the road, our milk measured in gallons, and our temperatures in Fahrenheit.</description>

      <description>Today in Tedium: Starting your own country is not something that&amp;rsquo;s particularly easy to do. For one thing, you have no idea if it&amp;rsquo;s going to work, plus you&amp;rsquo;re stuck having to figure out annoyingly complicated details like currency, how laws will be implemented, and how you&amp;rsquo;re going to defend your borders from jerks you don&amp;rsquo;t want on your land. Czech politician Vít Jedlicka, however, thinks he&amp;rsquo;s up to the task.</description>

      <title>Forget Rand Paul, Let&#39;s Talk Paul Rand</title>

      <description>Today in Tedium: A horrible thing has happened to search results in recent months. If you do a Google search for Paul Rand, nearly half the results on the first page—and all of the Google News results—are about Rand Paul, a man who has little to do with graceful, iconic logo design. In fact, if you actually knew something about logo design, you might be disappointed by Rand&amp;rsquo;s campaign logo. (It&amp;rsquo;s better than Hillary&amp;rsquo;s, we&amp;rsquo;ll give him that.</description>

      <title>Hay, Blinken!</title>

      <description>Today in Tedium: Apologies to Ronald Reagan, but no president has lent himself to kitsch and over-analysis as much as Abraham Lincoln, perhaps the best 16th president a democratically-elected country could ask for. There has been much written and collected about ol’ Abe, and as someone who has seen Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter in the theater and lived to tell the tale, I’m probably just as qualified as anyone to talk about Lincolniana.</description>

      <title>State of the #SOTU</title>
      <link>/2015/01/21/state-of-the-union-history/</link>

      <description>Today in Tedium: The State of the Union is generally the biggest speech of most years&amp;mdash;one that has taken a pretty massive role in our society, and is seen as an event that defines the political tone for the entire year. But a few interesting facts about the SOTU: It&amp;rsquo;s not always a speech, and its defining role as a defining political event is actually a relatively recent phenomenon as far as U.</description>
