      <description>Today in Tedium: Umbrellas are a good way to protect your head in case of inclement weather. Problem is, they’re not a perfect way. And that is made obvious by the fact that you’re sometimes hit by at least a little of the wet stuff even after you use such a device. If it gets windy (or even if it doesn&amp;rsquo;t), their structural integrity breaks down easily, exposing users to rain.</description>

      <description>Today in Tedium: In 1986, about a decade removed from his icon-setting days as lead singer of the Sex Pistols, British punk architect John Lydon released an album with his follow-up band, Public Image, Ltd., that had an extremely high-concept name. In fact, it didn&amp;rsquo;t technically have a name at all. If you bought the record on vinyl, it was called Album; if you bought it on CD, it was called Compact Disc.</description>

      <title>Swiss Army Life</title>

      <description>Today in Tedium: I’ve decided that I’m a big fan of Swiss army knives. Not the knives themselves, necessarily—I can never properly finagle my nails to pull the blades out of the casing—but the idea behind them. A single object with numerous uses is an incredibly powerful idea, and one that the Swiss Army Knife got to first. Something about this simple, elegant concept gets lost somewhere in a Bed Bath and Beyond run, probably because multi-tools probably cut away at their stuff-laden businesses.</description>
