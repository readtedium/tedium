      <description>Today in Tedium: If you’re in the U.S.—and perhaps, even if you’re not—every other message you’re getting right now is probably about this dang 2016 presidential election that’s coming to a close as we speak. Much fighting has been had. Many stories have been written. As a newsletter, Tedium exists to talk about dull, unusual things that basically aren’t, well … the 2016 election. Your brain most certainly needs a break from the electoral pummeling it’s going to be taking in the next few hours as Wolf Blitzer and Chris Matthews do the opposite of soothing your frayed nerves.</description>
