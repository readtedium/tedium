      <description>In the past couple of weeks, a bit of DuckTales-mania has hit the internet in a way that could best be described as giddy-ing. It’s understandable. It’s not every day Disney gives the fans what they want—and it ’s not every day that the results of that are pretty amazing.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EURi91Eb6I8
And it’s worth that level of nostalgia, because it’s reviving what perhaps was the most important cartoon of the ‘80s—both culturally and from an economic standpoint.</description>

      <description>Today in Tedium: The &amp;lsquo;80s were by and large a time of peace for the United States. The Cold War was thawing, and most of the conflicts the U.S. did get in took place over secured phone lines, rather than on the battlefield. Pop culture was far more likely to arm itself to the teeth during this era: Military-inspired cartoons like G.I. Joe: A Real American Hero ruled the after-school airwaves, while films like Rambo and stars like Chuck Norris and Dolph Lundgren were bringing explosive military action to the cineplex.</description>
