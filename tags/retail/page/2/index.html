    <h2 itemprop="about">The salad bar is something that many restauranteurs claim to have invented, but we know for sure that just one guy invented the sneeze guard.</h2>
    
    <p class="content" itemprop="description">
        Today in Tedium: Last month, a major lobbying group for the school lunch industry won a victory that involved salad bars. The School Nutrition Association, feeling the pressure because of what it called arduous nutrition rules, fought for (and won) a slightly more reasonable policy, including rules that specifically allowed schools to continue to offer salad bars to those super-grubby, messy kids. Some local health inspectors tried to veto the salad bars, claiming they created health hazards.

    <p class="content" itemprop="description">
        Today in Tedium: The dollar store is one of capitalism&rsquo;s greatest gifts to itself, if you think about it. Here&rsquo;s a business model that has, quite brilliantly, taken advantage of the ebbs and flows of supply and demand. It turns products that don&rsquo;t cost a lot to produce into things that actually make money hand over fist, despite the seemingly tight margins. Like companies that turn the liquidation of products into a viable business model and the makers of generic products, dollar stores have their place in the pantheon of retail.

    <h2 itemprop="about">The Klondike bar&#39;s catchy slogan isn&#39;t just marketing talk. The ice cream novelty was subject to a legal saga that nearly went to the Supreme Court.</h2>
    
    <p class="content" itemprop="description">
        Today in Tedium: What would you do for a Klondike bar? Most people would probably go to the nearest store, buy a package of chocolate-covered ice cream novelties, and make sure that the package eventually finds an icebox—well, as long as they don&rsquo;t finish said novelties first. (That said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m ashamed of what I did for a Klondike bar&rdquo; makes for a pretty good T-shirt slogan.) The food conglomerate Kraft was willing to do more than most for a Klondike bar: They saw an opportunity to usurp a rising regional dairy treat with their own version, blatantly ripping it off, causing a listeria outbreak, and finding themselves mired in legal battles, all within the span of a few years.

        Today in Tedium: True story—over the weekend, a restaurant attempted to suggest that I had a fake ID. The ID was a few years old, granted, and it has a small crack in it, but it nonetheless was a real form of identification. The waiter made a joke along the lines of the ID looking like a fake ID he used in college, which seemed like a bad joke until a few minutes later, when the manager came out and asked to look at it.

In fact, it didn&rsquo;t technically have a name at all. If you bought the record on vinyl, it was called Album; if you bought it on CD, it was called Compact Disc.

(Fun fact: He won that Grammy not with Semisonic, but for writing a Dixie Chicks song.) And often, they don&rsquo;t go home. Instead, they go to restaurants made for easing the next morning&rsquo;s hangovers. Or they do go home, but then they order late-night food that gets delivered to dorm rooms so fast, they freak.

    <p class="content" itemprop="description">
        Today in Tedium: Here’s a true fact that will blow your mind—the game-maker Sega started out as an American company, not as a Japanese one. Sure, much of its success came about after it moved to Japan, but it was not by any means a company that necessarily needed Japan, like notable competitors Nintendo, Sony, and NEC did. While the company had one solid era of major success in the American market—where the Sega Genesis went toe-to-toe with the Super NES and became one of the most popular systems of the ‘90s—it was Brazil where Sega really came into its own.

For generations, Dr. Bronner&rsquo;s 18-in-1 Pure Castile Soap has become an essential tool for many looking to stay clean without the extra chemicals they throw into more main-line soaps. But all the benefits that come with the soap (it&rsquo;s highly concentrated, it&rsquo;s effective at getting you clean) are joined by Emanuel Bronner&rsquo;s unusual opinions about just about everything—particularly his unique take on religion called the &ldquo;Moral ABC.
