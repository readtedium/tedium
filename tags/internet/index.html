    <h2 itemprop="about">A case in favor of browser tab minimalism, or closing the tabs you’re not using. Sometimes, information overload has its limits.</h2>
    
    <p class="content" itemprop="description">
        Today in Tedium: As a writer, I know a lot of other writers, and I hear a common refrain among the writerly set—they have billions of tabs open, each with a potential new thing to read that they hope to get to someday, but might not ever see. The tabs bleed into one other, their icons shrinking in width and slowly becoming unclickable. I should be that person. I’m not. Maybe I’m weird, but I’ve somehow managed to become a tab minimalist, and I think you should, too.

        Today in Tedium: People want an improbable deal, no matter how unlikely that deal might actually be.

(Instead, its fast decline took about a year, even with a high burn rate, and now the company is changing its model because it has no other choice.

        R. Stevie Moore is an extraordinary archivist of his own material. Recently, the online short film series Great Big Story released a superb mini documentary about Stevie and on April 6, 2018, R. Stevie Moore was featured on the front page of Wikipedia.  The page asked “Did you know R. Stevie Moore pioneered modern indie rock, earning him the sobriquet ‘the godfather of home recording?’”
Yes, Wikipedia. I believe we already knew that.

    <p class="content" itemprop="description">
        Earlier this year, I got incredibly fascinated by a book. One that had fallen off of store shelves nearly 60 years ago. The problem was, I had no way of getting hold of that book without actually going to the trouble of buying it.  Perhaps that was a little annoying, but David O. Woodbury’s 1956 work Let Erma Do It, which is titled after one of the first automated check-sorting systems ever produced, was a worthy book at the front end of the era of automation that has brought us so many things since.

    <p class="content" itemprop="description">
        Today in Tedium: Love it or hate it, the business-focused chat platform Slack clearly has done something right in its four years of existence. (Case in point: It’s worth $5 billion somehow, based on a recent investment by SoftBank.) It’s particularly strange for many users in the context of what it does. Breaking down all its integrations and emoji, and it’s basically a smart chat client. Chat clients, of course, have been around forever—particularly in the form of Internet Relay Chat, or IRC, and while it was pretty successful, it never crossed into pop culture the way Slack has.

        Today in Tedium: As I pointed out earlier this year, people love free stuff when it comes to the internet. Beyond communication, it may be the most popular use of the internet around. But what happens when a platform intended for communication becomes overwhelmed by free stuff? To put it simply, that’s what Usenet is. The protocol, with a history that goes back nearly 40 years, evolved from its arcane roots as a place for technically minded college students and sysops to communicate into a newbie-overrun protocol, then into a major hub for file sharing.

Stuff is falling out just as quickly, and pieces of history that would stick around in meatspace disappear in an instant online.

There&rsquo;s a sense of purity and simplicity there that is hard to recapture through other means—the sense that I&rsquo;m witnessing something culturally important that, in its own way, could change the world.
