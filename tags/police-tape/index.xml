Today in Tedium: On a daily basis, we&amp;rsquo;re surrounded by warning signs of varying shapes, sizes, and importance. These signs, more times then not, are often warning us about things we shouldn&amp;rsquo;t do, rather than things we should. Due to their commonality, we often don&amp;rsquo;t take them nearly as seriously as we shouldâ€”for example, &amp;ldquo;Signs,&amp;rdquo; the 1971 hippie-rock classic from the Five Man Electrical Band, mocks the sentiment lying behind a lot of these signs.</description>
