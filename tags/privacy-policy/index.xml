They’ve been raked over the coals by their users over a change to their privacy policy, that document on nearly every webpage that most people don’t really read unless they’re bored.

That didn’t go over well, even after a defense by the company’s CEO.</description>

If you&amp;rsquo;re reading Tedium—whether through email, our RSS feed, or our http://tedium.co/ website—you agree to certain things regarding how we use your data in running this newsletter.
Rather than just keeping those to ourselves, we have this page here to explain exactly what we&amp;rsquo;re doing as part of this interaction where you read our content and we write it for you. It may change from time to time, but ultimately the nuts and bolts will stay the same.</description>
