    <h2 itemprop="about">How the Toilet Duck rode its unique bottle design to mainstream success—and brought clever design to the bathroom, too.</h2>
    
    <p class="content" itemprop="description">
        It’s not easy to come up with a product that’s built around a completely, utterly unique design. Especially involving a topic as unflattering as cleaning a toilet.  But in the early 1980s, a man named Walter Düring had such a moment. The Swiss man’s company, Düring AG, had made a name for itself with the concept of decalcification, based on a formula his mother, Maria, came up with. But it was in the early 1980s that the firm had come up with something truly successful on a mainstream stage: A uniquely shaped nozzle that could spray decalcifiers into obscure crevices.

    <h2 itemprop="about">The challenges of getting a portable digital television to actually show a working signal stand in strong contrast to the analog days.</h2>
    
    <p class="content" itemprop="description">
        When it comes to technology, I have a lot of love for edge cases—situations where the march of innovation actually makes things a little bit worse.  Which means that I’ve become a pretty sizable fan of the YouTube channel Techmoan in recent months. Host Mat Taylor’s magical ability to drop matter-of-fact bits of knowledge about obscure AV equipment is unparalleled, and his clip this past weekend highlighting the way that the move to digital television (basically) killed the portable TV is no exception.

    <p class="content" itemprop="description">
        The veggie meat space is an interesting place these days for all sorts of reasons.
For one thing, variations of meat analogues that once were stuck in the frozen section are finally making it to the meat aisle in Safeway stores around the country, thanks to a whole bunch of persistence from the CEO of Beyond Meat. Not to be outdone are the food scientists at the Silicon Valley firm Hampton Creek, which announced this week that it was plotting its own lab-grown meat.

    <p class="content" itemprop="description">
        You may or may not have noticed this, but Tedium relies pretty heavily on archival content to exist. This newsletter and publication is not just about offering up weird facts: It&rsquo;s often about introducing facts that have otherwise been forgotten about by the public at large.  Sometimes, this takes me in some interesting directions. An example I regularly cite is my piece on lemon juice squeeze bottles. It was the rare piece I had the chance to mostly write ahead of time, and while there were some incredibly useful starting points on the issue from the Beach Packaging Design, I find it important that, even if an existing resource like this offers a starting point, I spend time doing some digging of my own.

    <p class="content" itemprop="description">
        In the past couple of weeks, a bit of DuckTales-mania has hit the internet in a way that could best be described as giddy-ing. It’s understandable. It’s not every day Disney gives the fans what they want—and it ’s not every day that the results of that are pretty amazing.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EURi91Eb6I8
And it’s worth that level of nostalgia, because it’s reviving what perhaps was the most important cartoon of the ‘80s—both culturally and from an economic standpoint.

    <p class="content" itemprop="description">
        When it comes to writing, I think that the biggest problem for a lot of people is properly organizing their ideas. There&rsquo;s just so much to put into a document, and without well-considered organization, it can get a little long, jumbled, and overly ranty. (Overly ranty is bad.)  But that doesn&rsquo;t necessarily mean that there isn&rsquo;t room to rethink the approach. Perhaps you shouldn&rsquo;t be writing in a totally linear format—perhaps you need to think in terms of a flow chart, one that is flexible to the whims of your prose.

        Gene Simmons, love him or hate him, has a history of trademarking very common things.  As any fan of the Scottish power-pop group Teenage Fanclub knows, the band’s label, Geffen, had to send a check to Simmons because the cover of the alternative rock band’s Bandwagonesque (which is a stellar album) featured a sack of money with a dollar sign on it—an image that Gene Simmons has long owned the trademark for, as it was the logo of his label, Simmons Records.

        No surprise to anyone, but large countries have this way of splaying out all over the world, with lots of their territories in unexpected areas.

But there&rsquo;s something weird about how many of these islands, mostly uninhabited today or used as minor scientific or military outposts, came under ownership of the United States.

Another entrepreneur, a guy named Josh Rogers, is attempting to make the case for tea made from seaweed.

        There was once a time when The Three Stooges ruled the late-night roost with a series of TV marathons that ensured the Vaudeville-era comedians would have a longer reach than many of their contemporaries. For decades, TBS owned this little niche.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_pN1eqjMWw
Even now, cable networks like IFC and AMC run the Stooges at odd times, in the middle of the night, mostly on weekends, as fillers between other movies.
