    <h2 itemprop="about">Why Elf Bowling, the animated holiday film, doesn’t live up to Elf Bowling, the not-a-virus computer game. The biggest problem, simply, is the animation.</h2>
    
    <p class="content" itemprop="description">
        **Last week’s article about the game Elf Bowling** really hit the sweet spot for a lot of folks. It’s a fun, maybe not groundbreaking game that is great to play for a few minutes—or based on your addiction level, a whole lot longer. (It should be remade for smartphones—the mechanics work really well for that medium.)  But by no means was the game, with its cheeky jokes, offbeat animation, and goofy concept, enough to carry a movie.

    <p class="content" itemprop="description">
        In the early 1990s, Chicago icon and outsider musician Wesley Willis wrote a tribute to one of his favorite dining establishments—McDonald&rsquo;s. Dubbed &ldquo;Rock and Roll McDonald&rsquo;s&rdquo; and set to a fun, keyboard-driven melody, the song extolls the virtues of the fast food haven. Willis once spent time both in and out of the McDonald&rsquo;s and surrounding area, making and selling his beautiful drawings most days.  (via the restaurant&rsquo;s Yelp page)

    <h2 itemprop="about">An 1956 book about the early history of automation finally hits digital shelves, thanks to a friend of mine. And its appearance is deliciously ironic.</h2>
    
    <p class="content" itemprop="description">
        Earlier this year, I got incredibly fascinated by a book. One that had fallen off of store shelves nearly 60 years ago. The problem was, I had no way of getting hold of that book without actually going to the trouble of buying it.  Perhaps that was a little annoying, but David O. Woodbury’s 1956 work Let Erma Do It, which is titled after one of the first automated check-sorting systems ever produced, was a worthy book at the front end of the era of automation that has brought us so many things since.

    <p class="content" itemprop="description">
        The strange thing about holiday classics, whether TV or film, is the way that they get drilled into the canon of nostalgia, a mush of themed entertainment along the lines of A Charlie Brown Christmas or A Christmas Story. These pieces of entertainment get repeated in part because we build memories around them. I wrote a piece about this phenomenon a couple of years ago.  But what happens if you create a piece of art that seems destined for the Christmas nostalgia ringer, and … for whatever reason, it just doesn’t happen?

    <p class="content" itemprop="description">
        A tattoo probably isn’t a binding legal document, but it certainly seems like a convincing argument. Clearly you must believe what you tattoo on yourself if you’re willing to go to that level of permanence, right?  But a recent saga involving a patient at a Miami hospital proved that question is a little more fraught than it seems. Doctors at Jackson Memorial Hospital, located at the University of Miami, were presented with a unconscious 70-year-old man who had a “Do Not Resuscitate” tattoo, along with his apparent signature, emblazoned on his chest.

But of course, while cryptocurrency is growing in popularity, bitcoin and other blockchain-based currencies can’t come close to making the claim to being the first digital currency.

        Manute Bol, a literal giant on the NBA court as the league&rsquo;s second-tallest player ever, was certainly an epic defender, but in some ways, he stood out because he was probably one of the most interesting player stories in NBA history.  And his story got more interesting this week after the college basketball coach who first discovered him laid out a surprising detail about the 7-foot-7 Sudanese player who became one of the best shot-blockers in the league’s history: Apparently, when Bol played basketball in the NBA, he was possibly 20 years older than his teammates—minimum.

        Wesley Willis was a prolific musician and wonderful artist. Beloved by most folks he ran across, it’s no surprise his legacy would live on in an unlikely place—your computer.  Some may recognize Mike the llama as the mascot of legendary music software WinAmp. But did you know, there is a somewhat tenuous, but quite obvious connection to Wesley built into the software?
Windows users in the mid-to-late 90s are probably used WinAmp or know of it in some capacity.

    <h2 itemprop="about">Behind one of the ‘80s most popular computer games is an impressive story about how an early computer helped a man overcome adversity.</h2>
    
    <p class="content" itemprop="description">
        It’s hard to track the history of mahjong solitaire, a Chinese game that came to America sometime in the 1920s, but one thing is for sure: More than 30 years ago, an electronic version of the game quietly took the computing world by storm.  Less known is the truly impressive feat that game represented. Originally built on the PLATO computing platform by Brodie Lockard in 1981, the computer game was groundbreaking both on a technical basis—the educational platform PLATO, as I wrote recently for Motherboard, inspired a lot broken ground—but also a personal one for Lockard.
