    <p class="content" itemprop="description">
        Today in Tedium: Operating systems are the cockroaches of the digital revolution. They’re everywhere, hiding in low-level crevices, and most of the time, you don’t really notice when they’re there—except, of course, when they draw attention to themselves. (Cough, cough Windows 8 cough.) But most of those operating systems fade from view—except when they don’t. Case in point: The company Arca Noae claims it’s about to launch a brand-new version of IBM’s coulda-been ‘90s contender, OS/2.

    <p class="content" itemprop="description">
        If you’re a regular reader of Y Combinator’s excellent mini-Reddit aggregator Hacker News (as I am), you start to see some trends arise. Programming languages and frameworks become incredibly popular (Ruby on Rails! Django! Node! Go!), but then start to lose their luster over time as programmers inevitably move onto the next coding innovation.  But the thing is, programming frameworks didn’t used to be this trendy, and some of the really old ones are becoming highly-sought-after in certain sectors because they’re becoming very uncommon.

    <p class="content" itemprop="description">
        These days, we have a whole lot of options for portably collecting information that needs to be put in a computer. But in 1960, that wasn’t always easy.  Usually, this meant paper—but considering they barely even had working OCR at the time, it also meant a lot of manual entry after the fact.
Fortunately, IBM had a solution to this problem: A portable device called the Port-A-Punch, which allowed workers in the field to create their own punch cards by hand to use for later.

        Today in Tedium: We live in a world where facial recognition has become so sophisticated that we’re being forced to ask very serious ethical questions about it. (In the U.S., the depth of the FBI’s facial-recognition capabilities are raising some serious questions from Congress. In China, it’s being used to detect toilet paper theft. To each country their own.) But I want to take a step back from the big hairy ethical questions and consider how we started on this road—with typography.

    <p class="content" itemprop="description">
        Dial-up modems were underpowered enough back in the days of AOL, but at the height of their popularity, manufacturers figured out a way to make them even worse.  During the late ‘90s, a spate of companies, including big name modem manufacturers like U.S. Robotics, Motorola, and PCtel, had the idea to replace hardware-based modems, which generally required a separate digital signal processor to manage the dial-up connection, with software-based equivalents, which took this task and put it on top of the CPU already being used.

They, understandably, get big in their britches, and fail to consider that their technology may not always be the greatest thing since sliced bread. First, they go into slow decline, then leadership problems pile up and the slow decline happens fast.

        Today in Tedium: The problem with laptops has, at least in recent years, been one of expandability. Once you buy a machine, you’re generally stuck with it, unless you’re willing to take it apart with repairs that have more in common with surgery than mechanics. Part of this has to do with the complexity of our modern machines, but a bigger part is the fact that, simply, upgradability has become less of a concern for manufacturers.

For those who skipped the Commodore and Apple II eras, who didn’t have a Videotex installed in their televisions, and had no idea who Commander Keen even was, this was the moment in time when they joined the internet revolution, brandishing their their AOL or Hotmail addresses for all the world to see.
