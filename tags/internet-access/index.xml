      <description>Today in Tedium: People want an improbable deal, no matter how unlikely that deal might actually be. Hence the strong interest in MoviePass, a company with a model so doomed that people were suggesting it would initially fail not long after it started offering free daily tickets at $9.99 per month. (Instead, its fast decline took about a year, even with a high burn rate, and now the company is changing its model because it has no other choice.</description>

      <description>Today in Tedium: The internet has not exactly lived its best life in the past twelve months. Between the tribalism and the stress of online culture we’ve seen of late, it’s understandable if even some of the internet’s biggest fans are having second thoughts on where things are headed. (And that’s not even counting the drama of the FCC’s net neutrality repeal.) Last week, The Verge made the case that 2017 was a year in which we wanted our internet to be smaller.</description>

      <description>Today in Tedium: As the recent vote in Congress over online privacy rules reminded us, people tend to hate their internet service providers. Case in point: Offbeat rocker Todd Rundgren once wrote and performed a poorly-aged song called “I Hate My Frickin’ ISP,” in which he railed against the anonymous loser that was preventing him from getting online, along with the service that promised him 20 free, addiction-starting hours. (It’s a bad entryway into his catalog, by the way; you’re way better off with “I Saw The Light.</description>

      <description>Today in Tedium: Earlier this week, I got a little grumpy over at Product Hunt, due to an undercurrent of snark around the fact that Netflix still has a DVD service. The reason for this was that too many people were skeptical about whether such a service was still necessary. It absolutely, totally is, and I’ll give you one reason why: Netflix’s DVD service has roughly 93,000 options, while its streaming service (between shows and movies) has fewer than 8,000 options—ensuring that DVDs will have a reason to exist for quite a while.</description>

      <description>Today in Tedium: Publishing words on a computer is not a difficult task these days. We have so many options to write words and distribute them through a computerized interface that we take the whole process for granted. (You probably published something in the time it took you to read the previous two sentences.) But there was a time when publishing through a computer was painful, cumbersome, and expensive. It also had little in common with the free-for-all that allows for the creation of all sorts of terrible/fascinating content online by random folks.</description>

      <description>Today in Tedium: We take so much of our online connections for granted. You probably visit hundreds of pages a day on a device fast enough to melt fabric, gobbling up gigabytes of data without even thinking about it. And there&amp;rsquo;s a good chance that if you didn&amp;rsquo;t have a connection, you would be mildly annoyed. But those connections were not a given in many parts of the world for years after the internet became commonplace in developed countries.</description>

      <description>Today in Tedium: When we go to a hotel, especially a nice one where we&amp;rsquo;re dropping a couple hundred bucks for a single night&amp;rsquo;s stay, we expect a lot out of the experience—something nicer than our schlubby apartment, preferably with an exotic or urban locale easily in sight. But when we open the door, no matter how ugly the motel we end up staying in turns out to be, there are always a handful of things that are always consistent—the TV and remote, the well-made bed, the cheap artwork on the walls.</description>
