      <description>Today in Tedium: As I pointed out earlier this year, people are unhealthily obsessed with mowing their lawns, despite the fact that the popularity of doing so only goes back about a century or two. And as seasons change, the mindset that leads people to freak out about their lawns stays the same—but the target changes. Odds are that if you live in a state north of the Mason-Dixon line, you&amp;rsquo;ve probably seen a dead leaf or two on the dirty ground.</description>

      <description>Today in Tedium: Here&amp;rsquo;s a tough problem. People love their cell phones, but the they hate the towers necessary to make those phones function. In fact, they really piss many people off, leading to situations where unnecessary fear-mongering wins the day, or leading people to worry that the towers will become eyesores that destroy their property values—or worse. So how do we get around the issue of these useful-but-ugly devices, anyway?</description>
