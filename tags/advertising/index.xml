      <description>Today in Tedium: In an era when HGTV has turned home repair into a lasting form of light entertainment and figures like Property Brothers Jonathan and Drew Scott and Fixer Upper power couple Chip and Joanna Gaines into big-name public figures and experts at monetizing their names and work, it’s worth remembering the foundation for this approach—specifically, the home-repair experts that came before. One of those experts is a guy by the name of Bob Vila.</description>

      <description>Today in Tedium: People want an improbable deal, no matter how unlikely that deal might actually be. Hence the strong interest in MoviePass, a company with a model so doomed that people were suggesting it would initially fail not long after it started offering free daily tickets at $9.99 per month. (Instead, its fast decline took about a year, even with a high burn rate, and now the company is changing its model because it has no other choice.</description>

      <description>Hey all, Ernie here with another slice of life from my pal David Buck. This time, he gives us the story of the Great American Motel Chain, and the man whose voice defines that story.
Today in Tedium: You may recognize the voice of Tom Bodett as the whimsical narrator of those hilarious Motel 6 radio spots that have been floating around the airwaves for the past thirty years. Today’s Tedium seeks to explore the career of the man behind the voice and how he helped take what was essentially a discount motel chain and helped change its image through what AdAge magazine calls “the greatest ads of all time.</description>

      <title>Tell Your Company&#39;s Story</title>

      <description>Here at Tedium, we take a lot of different angles on issues big and small—and quite often, the angles we hit on are related to the histories of companies large and small. Some of these companies have been around for decades, for generations, and have never had a real story told about them.  So I kind of wonder to myself: What if any company could tell its story, Tedium-style? Because, the fact of the matter is, every company has a story, and those stories matter in ways big and small.</description>

      <description>Editor’s note: Hey all, Ernie here—just wanted to let you guys know I’m handing the reins over to Andrew Egan once again. (If you want some of my thoughts on things, I did a recent interview with LetterList.) Last time, he told us about a time-storing device; this time, he has a stalling tactic of sorts. Check it out!
Today in Tedium: As we&amp;rsquo;ve noted before, long-running traditions in movies are slowly dying as media becomes digitized.</description>

      <title>The Four-Minute Villain</title>

      <description>One of the best parts of the streaming era is that you can avoid watching a ton of commercials if you don’t want to.
And in some ways, TV is responding to this change. Last year, Turner announced it was cutting back on commercials on its cable channels, and Fox—currently the market leader in commercial clutter—is trying to do the same. These days, 15 minutes of commercials in a single hour, give or take a couple of minutes, is about average.</description>

      <title>The Taboola of the 1930s</title>

      <description>Today in Tedium: When I see people complaining about the images and links shared through the &amp;ldquo;content discovery&amp;rdquo; platform Taboola and its cousin Outbrain—something I admittedly have been known to do—I inevitably find myself drawn to the &amp;ldquo;taboo&amp;rdquo; part of the Israeli company&amp;rsquo;s name. Because, if you think about it, it&amp;rsquo;s a really good descriptor of the images you see adding noise to nearly every large site on the internet. They show ways of life and images you wish didn&amp;rsquo;t exist—images of stuff that shouldn&amp;rsquo;t exist, if there was a God.</description>
