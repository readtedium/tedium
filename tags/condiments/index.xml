      <description>Today in Tedium: There have been many instances in my life that I’ve been told I’m a sauce obsessive. Maybe I pour a little too much A1 on a steak, a too-aggressive dip of a fry into a side of ranch dressing, a little too much salsa on the side of an omelet. I’m sure if I ran into Gordon Ramsay somewhere and he saw how much sauce I used, he would scold me.</description>

OK, here goes: Step away from your computer for ten to fifteen seconds and look in your fridge, particularly the door area of the fridge. (Waits …) Do you have any sauce packets just sitting around? If so, how many, and where did they come from? And why did you keep them?</description>

      <description>Today in Tedium: Last night, I learned a difficult fact the hard way—always wear gloves when handling the innards of hot peppers. In my efforts to create homemade jalapeño poppers, I covered my hands in oil to avoid getting stung, only to find that my strategy did not go far enough in preventing the capsaicin from scorching my poor fingers. After considering my options, I decided I would turn this experience into the hottest Tedium issue ever.</description>
