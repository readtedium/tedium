      <description>Tommy Wiseau, the legendary auteur of The Room, may not be a great filmmaker in the traditional sense, but he has a pretty enthused fanbase—a base of which I admit being a part of. And that fanbase, which has stuck with Wiseau through unusual projects like his 2015 Hulu series The Neighbors, has gotten a lot of mileage out of a single film that has owned the midnight movie circuit for years.</description>

      <description>Today in Tedium: People make mistakes often. We&amp;rsquo;re human. We&amp;rsquo;re fallible. It&amp;rsquo;s the thing that most easily proves that we&amp;rsquo;re not robotic. See, if a bot makes a mistake, it&amp;rsquo;s ten to one because a human programmed it incorrectly. And honestly, those errors aren&amp;rsquo;t necessarily bad things. We make mistakes every day, bounce back from them and are significantly more amazing as a result. They make us more human, more creative, and allow us to test what our limits are.</description>
