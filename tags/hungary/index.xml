      <description>Today in Tedium: If you&amp;rsquo;re watching the right digital substation, the message is hard to ignore. Ron Paul says we&amp;rsquo;re facing a catastrophic financial crisis that could leave you screwed. That&amp;rsquo;s a weird message to hear from any former politician, even one with the libertarian bonafides of Ron Paul. (His son Rand must be psyched that this is how he&amp;rsquo;s spending his retirement.) But the paid ads, which are designed to get you to buy some financial services you don&amp;rsquo;t need, nonetheless offer a funhouse mirror from which to consider the market forces that cause currency to lose its value.</description>
