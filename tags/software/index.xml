      <description>Update: Opera has claimed that this was an unintentional error and is fixing it on their end. The point about paying for browsers still stands, however, and as a result, I&amp;rsquo;ll keep this post up for posterity.
&amp;nbsp;
I find it fascinating that, of all the pieces of software we use on a daily basis, the one we literally use the most, our web browser, is one that we do not pay for.</description>

      <description>Today in Tedium: I know this sounds pretty crazy and dangerous, but there was once a time when we sent one another executable files via email. It was kinda like playing Russian Roulette with our operating systems, but we still did it. (No executables in this message. Promise.) And one of these executable files that was distributed over this medium that’s infamously prone to security problems is basically a goofy holiday-themed game.</description>

      <description>Today in Tedium: Email is such a pain in the butt. (Hopefully not this specific email.) We’ve been doing everything in our power to fight the influence it has on our lives, to minimize the spam, the marketing, the burden. That burden leads lots of folks to fruitlessly hunt for the perfect email client like I hunt for the perfect word processor. Others have followed the path of least resistance: Either Gmail or Outlook.</description>

      <description>Today in Tedium: The dream of shareware, as previously discussed, was simply this: As long as you could put a good taste of a product onto a floppy disk, you could theoretically compete with companies ten times your size. Or bigger. It leveled the playing field for distribution, and that meant even if you were building an app in your living room on your night off while eating the cheapest ramen you could find, you could still feasibly take on giant software companies that can afford to promote themselves on television.</description>

      <description>Today in Tedium: Before software, purchases generally worked like this: You walked into a store, you bought a physical object, and that object was yours until it became damaged or outdated, and you threw it out. But software, being much smaller in physical space than any commercial object that came before it, wasn&amp;rsquo;t limited by these rules. Data came in bits and bytes, and could be dripped out or distributed in any number of ways.</description>

      <description>Today in Tedium: Last week, one of the men who created the internet as we know it sounded the alarms on its future. Vinton Cerf, a Google executive and one of the architects of ARPANET, noted that decades of files could be lost to history, with no way to access the documents, due to lacking digital preservation efforts. “When you think about the quantity of documentation from our daily lives that is captured in digital form, like our interactions by email, people’s tweets, and all of the world wide web, it’s clear that we stand to lose an awful lot of our history,” he said, according to The Guardian.</description>
