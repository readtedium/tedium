      <description>Hey guys, Ernie here with a piece from the Tedium archives about Madison Avenue’s infiltration of classic video games, which is legitimately a thing that happened.
Today in Tedium: Here&amp;rsquo;s a challenge for you: Take your favorite video game of the &amp;lsquo;90s and don&amp;rsquo;t think about it in terms of the quality of the game, its graphical quality, or its replayability—especially if it&amp;rsquo;s a game based on an existing license. Instead, think of that game in terms of it merely being a vessel to market another product: say, a movie like Terminator 2, a toy like a Barbie doll, or a musical act like Aerosmith.</description>
