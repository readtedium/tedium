      <description>_Editor’s note: Tonight’s Tedium is an updated rerun of a classic issue about the stuff that newspapers get rid of when trying to slim down. Unspoken in this article: Usually, the final step of this process is people. And with the recent sagas of L.A. Weekly and (on the digital side of things) DNAinfo, now felt like a good time to revisit. (If you&amp;rsquo;ve read before, keep reading; there&amp;rsquo;s a new section on newsprint.</description>

      <description>Today in Tedium: When I recently wrote about airport stores, one of the most interesting (albeit minor) facets of the piece was the fact that airport travelers are generally considered a captive audience, making it easy for shops to jack up prices. But they&amp;rsquo;re far from the only industry sector that knows a thing or two about captive audiences. Just ask textbook publishers; they&amp;rsquo;re experts at this sort of thing. (It&amp;rsquo;s like they&amp;rsquo;re selling EpiPens.</description>

      <description>Today in Tedium: There&amp;rsquo;s something wild about watching people play this game that everyone won&amp;rsquo;t shut up about. And I think it has a lot to do with how it shifts social order in an unexpected way.
