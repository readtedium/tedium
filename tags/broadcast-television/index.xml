      <description>Today in Tedium: I’m going to say it right now—we totally got lucky with our acquisition of the Genesis Storytime video earlier this month, which, while it didn’t bring in millions of views, may be the most impressive thing we’ve ever done. (Nice work, Andrew!) More likely, a hunt for an obscure video will end in tears, possibly a dead end. (We were not the first people to hunt for video of that channel.</description>
