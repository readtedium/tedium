                        <p><strong>Over the weekend</strong>—inspired by the forthcoming release of <em>The Disaster Artist</em>, a film about <a href="http://amzn.to/2gYL0nN">my favorite movie</a>—I finally saw <em>Ed Wood</em>. It took me way too long.</p>

<p><a href="http://amzn.to/2gYArB4"><em>Ed Wood</em> is a great film</a> about a terrible filmmaker, as well as a great story about the creative muse, and how it sometimes doesn’t hit the cues of the popular taste. Wood’s masterwork, <em>Plan 9 From Outer Space</em>, doesn’t need any more words written about it—but the origin story of its reputation as the “worst movie” is nearly as fascinating as its creation. Long story short: It was included in a book of terrible movies, by fan request. (The late, lamented <em>Dissolve</em> <a href="https://thedissolve.com/features/movie-of-the-week/623-how-plan-9-from-outer-space-earned-and-lost-the-ti/">has the full story</a>.)</p>

<p>Lots of stories like this exist in both the film and the music sphere—on the audio front, The Shaggs’ life story <a href="http://ew.com/article/2013/01/30/the-shaggs-musical/">has long been rumored</a> as a possible film—but one of the most interesting of these tales might be that of <a href="http://www.shooby.com/">Shooby Taylor</a>.</p>

<p>Taylor, a man nicknamed “The Human Horn,” had the world’s briefest brush with fame of all time. <a href="http://www.shooby.com/mp3/index.html">His talent</a>—an ability to make goofy-but-endearing horn-like scat sounds over pre-recorded music—was admittedly an acquired taste. While he was never successful, he was able to focus on music for a long period of time, thanks to a pension he received after an on-the-job injury while working at the U.S. Post Office. He spent a lot of time recording, and eventually, something that looked like a big break emerged.</p>

<p>Unfortunately for Taylor, that break came in October of 1987, as part of the amateur competition of <em>Showtime At the Apollo</em>. (Many reports, <a href="http://www.allmusic.com/artist/shooby-taylor-mn0000036311">including on sites like AllMusic</a>, date this performance to 1983; however, the TV show did not premiere until 1987.)</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MutYIgL4Gbk">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MutYIgL4Gbk</a></p>

<p>The performance is a tough watch. The episode’s comic, Rich Aviles, calls Shooby “Scooby,” something reflected <a href="http://bit.ly/2w8awd5">in the video’s historic records</a>. Taylor, who was game for the appearance, made an awkward autofellatio joke. (“I blow me,” he said. Accurate for the Human Horn, but why?)</p>

<p>And when he got on stage, he was booed basically automatically—and within a minute and a half, he was gone.</p>

<p>Big break, bust. At least Ed Wood got to share his art with the world in full. (To be fair, it’s a tough crowd. Lauryn Hill <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E00q3cKwuvM">got booed that season too</a>, and she has six Grammys.)</p>

<p>But Taylor got a second chance at notoriety, however brief. Like Wood, he came back to prominence because of a book—Irwin Chusid’s classic outsider music tome <a href="http://amzn.to/2gYhDC6"><em>Songs in the Key of Z</em></a>.</p>

<p><a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=fydjCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA145">Chusid noted</a> that Taylor actually had numerous second chances at the limelight he never even knew about: Rhino Records, a major label, briefly considered releasing his music, only to be scared off by the licensing fees associated with the tunes he sang over, and <em>The Late Show With David Letterman</em> entertained the idea of him performing on the show, until a casting agent had a change of heart. None of this happened with any of his knowledge.</p>

<p>Even if folks knew where he was, Taylor likely wouldn’t have been able to make the <em>Late Show</em> gig. Having suffered a stroke in the mid-‘90s, he disappeared from the public eye, <a href="http://www.keyofz.com/shooby.htm">only re-emerging briefly</a> a year or two after Chusid’s book was released, thanks to the diligence of a WFMU listener. He died in 2003.</p>

<p>In an alternate universe somewhere, Shooby Taylor and <a href="http://tedium.co/2017/01/24/scatman-john-stuttering-success-story/">Scatman John</a> would be touring the world together, topping the charts with their unique takes on scat music. But instead, Shooby’s televised output is limited to a single 90-second clip in which he faced the world’s toughest crowd.</p>
