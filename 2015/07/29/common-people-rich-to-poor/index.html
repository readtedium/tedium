  <strong>Today in Tedium:</strong> The greatest six minutes that <a href="http://amzn.to/1DJVhUG">the British band Pulp</a> ever put to wax pulled off a lot of small victories as it leaped into a larger one. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuTMWgOduFM">&ldquo;Common People&rdquo;</a> highlighted the lingering definitions of class that the U.K. still hasn&rsquo;t managed to shake; it drew a vibrant character sketch that few songwriters can put together in a single album, let alone a pop song; and it broke through to the mainstream at a time when most British music buyers were focused mostly on Blur and Oasis. <a href="http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/6052251/pulps-common-people-declared-top-of-the-britpops">It&rsquo;s still highly regarded</a>, and Jarvis Cocker&rsquo;s masterwork <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/may/10/common-people-pulp-cocker-greek-girl"><em>still</em> generates cultural discussion</a>. But more than two decades after the song <a href="http://www.officialcharts.com/charts/singles-chart/19950528/7501/">reached its peak on the U.K.&rsquo;s Official Singles Chart</a>, I have to admit to being curious—<em>are</em> there people like the Greek college student who likes slumming at grocery stores and swilling working-class pubs? Are there people who pretend to be lower-class just because they dig being poor? We have to start it somewhere, so we&rsquo;ll start it there. <em>— Ernie @ Tedium</em>

  <strong>The estimated percentage</strong> of respondents with more than $5 million in assets that did not consider themselves rich, <a href="http://www.ubs.com/content/dam/WealthManagementAmericas/documents/investor-watch-3Q2013-report.pdf">according to a 2013 UBS study</a>. The study, which emphasized that lacking stability was the key cause of this opinion, also found that 50 percent of respondents considered a lack of financial constraints as the key signifier of wealth.

<h3 id="russia-s-richest-man-likes-hanging-out-with-the-regular-folk">Russia&rsquo;s richest man likes hanging out with the regular folk</h3>

<p><strong>Vladimir Potanin may not</strong> be Russia&rsquo;s richest man for much longer—he recently divorced his wife, Natalia Potanina, and she wants nearly half of his $14.8 billion fortune for herself.</p>

<p>But Potanin, the chairman of the conglomerate Interros and a major beneficiary of Russia&rsquo;s move away from communism, is totally cool with hanging out among the public rather than primarily hanging around people at the same financial level as him.</p>

<p>So when he goes out, he skips the bodyguards; he says he doesn&rsquo;t need them. Instead, he tries for a more approachable strategy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is not good to demonstrate your luxury and your wealth: to rub it in the faces of others is insulting,&rdquo; <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/the-new-cool-for-russias-super-rich-slumming-it-2012-8">he said in a 2012 interview with Reuters</a>. &ldquo;So you should be modest, try not to insult people by showing that you can do what they cannot.&rdquo;</p>

<p>That doesn&rsquo;t, of course, mean taking the Metro; he draws the line there, according to the Reuters interview.</p>

<p>Beyond the snarking, it&rsquo;s worth pointing out that Potanin&rsquo;s divorce could have a pretty big impact on the philanthropy scene. As one of the signatories of the <a href="http://givingpledge.org/">Giving Pledge</a>, he had promised to give away much of his wealth before his death.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I also see it as a way to protect my children from the burden of extreme wealth, which may deprive them of any motivation to achieve anything in life on their own,&rdquo; he said in his letter.</p>

<p>Time will tell if his wife feels the same way.</p>

<p><strong>— An 1884 <em>New York Times</em> article</strong> discussing <a href="http://query.nytimes.com/mem/archive-free/pdf?res=9A04E3D91338E033A25757C1A96F9C94659FD7CF">the then-recent popularity of &ldquo;slumming&rdquo;</a> among the London elite. The article has a number of fairly absurd lines, but this one takes the cake: &ldquo;What a pleasure it must be to a sufferer imprisoned in one of these tenements, to receive a flower with its color and its green leaves and stems!&rdquo; <a href="http://cityroom.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/07/06/when-slumming-was-the-thing-to-do/?_r=0">A 2009 <em>Times</em> piece on the phenomenon</a> noted that the &ldquo;slumming&rdquo; trend remained popular until immediately after World War II.</p>

<h3 id="the-director-of-ace-ventura-pet-detective-gave-up-butt-jokes-and-his-fortune">The director of <em>Ace Ventura: Pet Detective</em> gave up butt jokes … and his fortune</h3>

<p><em><strong>&ldquo;I was standing in the house</strong> that my culture had taught me was a measure of the good life. I was struck with one very clear, very strange feeling: I was no happier.&rdquo;</em></p>

<p>Director Tom Shadyac had recently been in a serious bike accident, causing a head injury that nearly killed him. On the road to recovery, <a href="http://www.oprah.com/oprahshow/Tom-Shadyac-From-Millionaire-to-Mobile-Home">he had a revelation</a>: He didn&rsquo;t actually like the fame and fortune he had earned as the director of hit films such as <em>Ace Ventura: Pet Detective</em>, <em>The Nutty Professor</em>, and <em>Bruce Almighty</em>. So he started shedding all of it.</p>

<p>He got rid of the massive house and moved into a trailer park. He put nearly all of his money towards funding charitable efforts like a homeless shelter, and instead of directing another big-budget Hollywood film, he instead decided to focus his energy on the kind of project that barely even stands a chance of making back its budget.</p>

<p>The film <a href="http://amzn.to/1U4FARz"><em>I Am</em>, which came out in 2010</a>, is basically a story about Shadyac&rsquo;s search for deeper meaning. He spends the film talking about deep stuff with high-profile intellectuals like Noam Chomsky and Thom Hartmann, and ultimately, his search for answers turns into more questions. (If you&rsquo;re curious, Roger Ebert called the film &ldquo;as watchable as a really good TV commercial, and just as deep,&rdquo; but then Shadyac was never a critic&rsquo;s filmmaker, anyway.)</p>

<p>Though it&rsquo;s been rumored <a href="http://deadline.com/2013/02/tom-shadyac-eyes-the-intouchables-remake-as-return-to-comedy-helming-411892/">as recently as 2013</a> that Shadyac might make a return to the director&rsquo;s chair eventually, he&rsquo;s more recently been trying something else on for size—becoming a college professor <a href="http://www.thelpbc.com/lpbc-in-the-news/hollywood-hitmaker-tom-shadyac-drops-out-gives-back-with-u-of-m-class-and-more-by-john-beifuss-in-th">at the University of Memphis</a>. He&rsquo;s teaching a storytelling course there—which definitely seems like a bit of an upgrade from the usual adjunct.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The job of an educator is to teach students to see themselves,&rdquo; <a href="http://college.usatoday.com/2015/03/06/directors-class-creates-community-in-memphis/">Shadyac told <em>USA Today College</em></a> back in March. &ldquo;That’s my highest hope—to awaken students to who they are, and to provide the tools to walk their own unique path with courage and conviction.&rdquo;</p>

<p>His fame hasn&rsquo;t faded too much despite his move to get rid of the fortune—in 2013, <a href="http://amzn.to/1U4IHcf">he wrote a best-selling book</a>. But there&rsquo;s a lot to like about the strategy. If you&rsquo;re willingly trying to shed the material stuff, follow the Tom Shadyac school of minimalism.</p>

  <h3 id="to-the-contrary-all-i-have-is-what-i-have-given-away">&ldquo;To the contrary, all I have is what I have given away.&rdquo;</h3>

</div>

<p><strong>— George W. Carroll,</strong> a Texas oil tycoon who gave away his fortune, <a href="http://www.beaumontenterprise.com/news/article/Beaumont-millionaire-gave-away-fortune-4679162.php">responding to someone</a> asking if he wished he had kept any of his money. Carroll had a change of conscience about his extreme wealth after seeing how it was affecting his local community and leading them into decadence. So he took a different road; he gave all his money away and got involved in politics, at one point running for vice president on the Prohibitionist ticket. When he died in 1935, he passed on in a tiny room inside of a YMCA building that his fortune had built.</p>

</div>
<div class="md-graybox">
  <p><strong>In late 2013,</strong> Stephen Colbert created a term that gets to the truthiness of the matter here. At the time, a South African resort was receiving some international criticism for its &ldquo;Shanty Town&rdquo; experience, <a href="http://www.emoya.co.za/p23/accommodation/shanty-town-for-a-unique-accommodation-experience-in-bloemfontein.html">which allows up to 52 people at a time</a> to stay inside huts built from corrugated iron sheets.</p>

<p>If that sounds like the worst thing ever, just wait until you read this quote from their website: &ldquo;This is the only Shanty Town in the world equipped with wireless internet access!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Anyway, Colbert, doing what he does best, cut to the heart of the matter, <a href="http://www.truthdig.com/avbooth/item/colbert_eyes_wide_shut_to_other_peoples_suffering_20131113">and described the situation</a> as &ldquo;glumming,&rdquo; or &ldquo;glamorous slumming.&rdquo;</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s a difference between glumming and jumping in with both feet and giving it all away. One suggests it&rsquo;s all about what you&rsquo;ll get out of it; the other suggests that it&rsquo;s a variation of normcore—a fashion style, the equivalent of hitting a dive bar because the scene fits your mood. As soon as you get home, the dinge of the pub is like a long-ago memory.</p>

<p><a href="http://amzn.to/1ONqUDf">The director of <em>Liar, Liar</em></a> deciding that the wealth isn&rsquo;t for him is admirable. But I think we can all agree that spending a week in a fake shanty town is pretty awful—almost as bad <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/29/world/africa/american-hunter-is-accused-of-killing-cecil-a-beloved-lion-in-zimbabwe.html?_r=0">as killing a lion for the thrill of it</a>.</p>

<p>Oh, the stupid things you&rsquo;ll do, because you think that poor is cool.</p>
