  <strong>Today in Tedium:</strong> It&rsquo;s the oldest scam in the book, and people fall for it all the freaking time. Pyramid schemes of all shapes and sizes have been bilking people out of their hard-earned money for generations, and you&rsquo;re probably gonna get screwed out of your hard-earned money before you even realize it. Today&rsquo;s Tedium is all about scams that leave scars way deeper than all the money stolen. <em>— Ernie @ Tedium</em>

<h3 id="if-i-run-into-dave-rhodes-on-the-street-i-m-gonna-punch-him-in-the-face">If I run into Dave Rhodes on the street, I&rsquo;m gonna punch him in the face</h3>

<p><strong>Usenet was a weird place even when it was popular.</strong> The massive open forum was culturally fascinating and a little dangerous—like walking down the street in an up-and-coming neighborhood that hadn&rsquo;t yet found its identity. You were excited to be a part of the scene, even as you were worried you might be walking down a dark alley without realizing it.</p>

<p>On the plus side, the dark alleys were pretty easy to spot, because they led to people like &ldquo;Dave Rhodes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rhodes was the name often used on a common piece of spam that was popular on Usenet in the late 1980s. Rhodes was commonly portrayed as a typically broke ne&rsquo;er-do-well who had finally struck gold.</p>

<p>His trick? He had figured out <a href="http://www.cs.rutgers.edu/~watrous/dave-rhodes.html">how to turn the chain letter into a magical digital tool</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;In October 1988, I received a letter in the mail telling me how I could earn $50,000 dollars or more whenever I wanted. I was naturally very skeptical and threw the letter on the desk next to my computer. It&rsquo;s funny though, when you are desperate, backed into a corner, your mind does crazy things. I spent a frustating day looking through the want ads for a job with a future. The pickings were sparse at best. That night I tried to unwind by booting up my computer and calling several bulletin boards. I read several of the message posts and than glanced at the letter next to the computer. All at once it came to me, I now had the key to my dreams.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Before there were Nigerian scammers, Dave Rhodes—a guy who probably isn&rsquo;t real, <a href="http://www.faqs.org/faqs/net-legends-faq/part2/">even though he has an alleged backstory</a>—was the closest thing to a Nigerian scammer one could find.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.theguardian.com/money/2003/mar/29/scamsandfraud.jobsandmoney">_The Guardian_ once went on a hunt for the dude</a>, but even they came up short. Perhaps, like most of Usenet and the money that was mailed to Dave Rhodes, he&rsquo;s better off left to history.</p>

  <h3 id="five-types-of-schemes-that-you-ve-probably-already-fallen-for">Five types of schemes that you&rsquo;ve probably already fallen for</h3>

<ol>
<li><strong>Pyramid schemes:</strong> Ever hear of the term &ldquo;pay it forward&rdquo;? Pyramid schemes are basically the opposite—you&rsquo;re really paying it back. As in, people who are newer to a pyramid scheme pay back the people up top. It sounds like a good idea until you realize that you&rsquo;ve basically built this giant pyramid on a weak foundation—one that&rsquo;s bound to break when everyone gets smart to the way chain letters work.</li>
<li><strong>Ponzi schemes:</strong> Much like pyramid schemes, Ponzi schemes rely on the people below them to pay for folks at higher levels. However, there are two big differences—there&rsquo;s usually one central point of failure, and people who invest in Ponzi schemes keep investing out of a desire to get stronger returns. This big difference is <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/how-bernie-madoffs-ponzi-scheme-worked-2014-7">why Bernie Madoff was building a Ponzi scheme</a>, not a pyramid scheme.</li>
<li><strong>Advance fee fraud:</strong> If someone asks you to send them a little bit of money so they can eventually pay you a lot of money, you probably should delete that Nigerian guy&rsquo;s email and pretend you never got it in the first place. As _Priceonomics_ notes, <a href="http://priceonomics.com/the-email-scam-with-centuries-of-history/">the scam predates the internet by hundreds of years</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Telemarketing fraud:</strong> If you get a phone call from &ldquo;Rachel From Cardholder Services,&rdquo; hang up and consider destroying your phone. <a href="http://www.consumeraffairs.com/news/rachel-from-cardholder-services-pays-up-011615.html">The infamous robocaller</a> trying to offer you a drop in your credit card interest rate something she can&rsquo;t legally offer you—and you&rsquo;d be smart not to listen.</li>
<li><strong>Timeshares:</strong> That vacation home in a nice area might seem like a good investment, but it probably isn&rsquo;t. The reason? Welp, they&rsquo;re designed to do two things: Nickel and dime the hell out of owners, and be useless for reselling because there are so many around. <a href="https://www.consumer.ftc.gov/articles/0073-timeshares-and-vacation-plans">Let the FTC set you straight here</a>.</li>
</ol>

  <h3 id="when-you-shine-sunlight-on-madoff-it-makes-it-difficult-for-madoff-to-find-victims-the-same-thing-is-happening-at-herbalife">&ldquo;When you shine sunlight on Madoff it makes it difficult for Madoff to find victims. The same thing is happening at Herbalife.&rdquo;</h3></p>

<p></div>
 </p>

<p><strong>— Activist investor Bill Ackman,</strong> <a href="http://www.cnbc.com/id/102314897">speaking to CNBC back in January</a>about his years-long bet against Herbalife, a nutritional supplements company which he has long claimed is a pyramid scheme. Ackman has for years shorted the company with an investment of more than $1 billion dollars, meaning that if Herbalife&rsquo;s massive network of goes belly up, he&rsquo;ll be there to pick up the pieces. Herbalife, which has more than 2.6 million active sellers worldwide, has been so consistently attacked by Ackman that <a href="http://www.therealbillackman.com/">they launched an anti-Ackman site earlier this month</a>. Problem is, <a href="http://www.factsaboutherbalife.com/">Ackman launched a site of his own years ago</a>—complete with a graphic that looks like a pyramid.</p>

<h3 id="the-2012-presidential-candidate-that-helped-multi-level-marketing-run-wild-all-over-utah">The 2012 presidential candidate that helped multi-level marketing run wild all over Utah</h3>

<p><strong>Jon Huntsman was a well-regarded governor,</strong> and he was the rare Republican who ran for president during the 2012 election that some Democrats could see themselves embracing. He didn&rsquo;t gain any momentum in his presidential run, but he didn&rsquo;t completely embarrass himself either, so points for Jon.</p>

<p>The former Utah governor and onetime Chinese ambassador definitely spent a lot of time talking up his business credentials. But the problem isn&rsquo;t the support of businesses, but the _type_ of businesses he backed.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s right, guys, Huntsman signed legislation effectively making multi-level marketing legal in Utah.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The prior law had defined a pyramid scheme as, among other things, a business where people involved derive their compensation primarily from recruiting people into the sales scheme, rather than from retail sales themselves,&rdquo; Mother Jones writer Stephanie Mencimer<a href="http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2011/09/jon-huntsman-pyramid-scheme-mlm">explained in 2011</a>. &ldquo;But with a few small wording changes to the law in 2006, now as long as a Utah company&rsquo;s salespeople sell something like noni juice or acai berry supplements—to anyone, regardless of whether they are simply other salespeople roped into the scheme—they can&rsquo;t be prosecuted or sued for running a pyramid scheme.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Now, companies such as Usana and Nu Skin can operate out of the state relatively unscathed, building influence along the way. (A similar business model, the telemarketing-based “online business opportunity,” <a href="http://www.cityweekly.net/utah/dialing-for-dollars/Content?oid=2161608">has also gained a degree of success</a> thanks to some smart lobbying.)</p>

<p>Huntsman seems like a nice enough guy, but something tells us that we were better off getting someone else as president in 2012.</p>

</div>
<div class="md-graybox">
  <p><strong>Now, multi-level marketing schemes like those we covered above</strong> are often bad news for the people directly affected by the scheme. The main reason for that? Generally, when the scheme is caught, there&rsquo;s little to no money left, because all the ill-gotten goods have gone to other people in the scheme, with people near the top getting the most.</p>

<p>An example of this is what happened with Fortune Hi-Tech Marketing, a company that opened its doors in 2001 and evolved into an elaborate multi-level marketing scheme—one that lured in more people through a bunch of indecipherable jargon.</p>

<p>After the Federal Trade Commission shut the scheme down, <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/blogs/business-blog/2014/05/entrepreneurs-when-it-comes-pyramid-schemes-dont-be-denial">here&rsquo;s what they found left in the company&rsquo;s coffers</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>To settle the case, the defendants have agreed to a lifetime ban from multilevel marketing. The stipulated order imposes a judgment of more than $169 million, which will be partially suspended when they surrender certain assets with an estimated value of at least $7.75 million, including property from the estate of defendant Paul Orberson, who died while the case was pending. What kind of valuables are we talking about? A farm in Kentucky, a Florida condo, a house in South Carolina, a BMW, a Jeep, two boats, a sports memorabilia collection, coins, and bullion. The jet skis? They’re going, too.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So, the 350,000 people who signed up for the multi-level marketing scheme, in hopes of fortune? They&rsquo;ll be lucky to get back a nickel on the dollar.</p>
