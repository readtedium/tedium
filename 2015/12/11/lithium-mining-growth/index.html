  <strong>Today in Tedium:</strong> Those <a href="http://amzn.to/1M6nQhY">stupid hoverboards</a> that have shown up just about everywhere lately have a big problem, and its name is lithium. In recent weeks, numerous news stories have cropped up about these devices and <a href="http://www.kirotv.com/news/news/video-hoverboard-burst-flame-auburn-mall/npfc3/">their tendency to cause fires</a>. The problem is that many of these devices are knockoffs that use really cruddy low-quality lithium batteries, batteries so cruddy that airlines are now telling customers <a href="http://www.wsj.com/articles/airlines-ban-hoverboards-over-fire-concerns-1449753167">to leave their stupid wheeled floaty devices at home</a>. Reading this, I got to thinking; you know, considering how common lithium is in our daily lives, particularly in <a href="http://amzn.to/1IZ1YVG">the batteries that charge our devices</a>, we don&rsquo;t really talk about it very much. As it turns out, perhaps we should. Today&rsquo;s Tedium is about lithium, a material that could become as important to our society as oil—and could set a few fires along the way. <em>— Ernie @ Tedium</em>

  <strong>The size, in tons,</strong> of Bolivia&rsquo;s lithium reserve, according to estimates by the U.S. government. That makes it one of the largest lithium reserves in the world. As the country <a href="http://www.mnn.com/earth-matters/wilderness-resources/stories/battle-salar-de-uyuni">has an income per capita of less than $3,000 a year</a>, the country&rsquo;s supply of lithium is immensely valuable and could greatly improve the region&rsquo;s fortunes. President Evo Morales <a href="http://latino.foxnews.com/latino/news/2015/04/02/bolivia-plans-to-invest-617-mn-to-develop-lithium-industry/">promised to invest $617 million</a> into further developing the country&rsquo;s lithium supply, which is located largely within the Uyuni Salt Flat.

<h3 id="our-best-method-of-acquiring-lithium-involves-pulling-it-from-saltwater">Our best method of acquiring lithium involves pulling it from saltwater</h3>

<p><strong>The reason that the Uyuni Salt Flat</strong> is suddenly such a valuable source of lithium has a lot to do with how lithium is acquired in most cases. While it&rsquo;s possible to cull it from traditional mining methods, it&rsquo;s more effective to simply take saltwater, or brine, let it evaporate, and then separate out the lithium and other elements through the usage of chemicals.</p>

<p>The salt flat, a dried up lake, still has lots of underground water, and that water has a much higher concentration of lithium than most types of salt water out there, which is why Bolivia is sitting on a gold mine that could make one day make it as powerful as Saudi Arabia on the world stage.</p>

<p>Rodinia Lithium, a Canadian lithium-production firm with <a href="http://rodinialithium.com/projects/other_projects/">major interests in nearby Argentina</a>, notes that extracting lithium from brine is so effective that other methods of lithium production seem wasteful in comparison.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The economics of obtaining lithium carbonate from brine are so favorable that most hard rock production has been priced out of the market,&rdquo; <a href="http://rodinialithium.com/lithium/lithium_mining/">the company explains</a>.</p>

<p>The rising popularity of brine-based mechanisms for extracting lithium <a href="http://www.forbes.com/forbes/2008/1124/034.html">led to a period when the U.S. had stopped producing lithium</a>, despite having one of the largest supplies in the world in Kings Mountain, North Carolina. (The reason? That mine&rsquo;s supply was extracted from the mineral spodumene using a much more complex process. It&rsquo;s still around, and even <a href="http://energy.gov/articles/expanded-north-carolina-lithium-facility-opens-boosting-us-production-key-manufacturing">got some assistance from the federal government</a> in 2009, but its output is dwarfed by the South American mines.)</p>

<p>But there&rsquo;s still room for the U.S. to make a comeback on the lithium front—and we can thank Tesla Motors for that. Back in September, the car company, which is going to be producing giant lithium-ion batteries in its Nevada-based Gigafactory. That factory is roughly 200 miles away from a planned lithium mine in Esmeralda County, Nevada, and back in September, Tesla Motors announced a deal with <a href="http://www.pureenergyminerals.com/">Pure Energy Materials</a>, the company behind the project, to help <a href="http://fortune.com/2015/09/16/tesla-lithium-gigafactory-nevada/">supply lithium for its car batteries</a>.</p>

<p>They&rsquo;ll be digging deep into the brine, shipping the raw materials to Tesla Motors, and helping to make a bunch of batteries.</p>

<p>Great, but will it be enough lithium for all the electric cars on the road?</p>

  <h3 id="if-all-cars-are-to-become-electric-within-50-years-fears-of-a-crunch-in-lithium-resources-and-thus-a-staggering-price-increase-such-as-that-faced-today-with-fossil-fuels-are-permeating">&ldquo;If all cars are to become electric within 50 years, fears of a crunch in lithium resources—and thus a staggering price increase such as that faced today with fossil fuels—are permeating.&rdquo;</h3>

</div>

<p><strong>— Jean-Marie Tarascon,</strong> a professor of chemistry at the Collège de France in Paris, writing in a <em>Nature Chemistry</em> article <a href="http://www.nature.com/nchem/journal/v2/n6/full/nchem.680.html">about the potential of a &ldquo;gold rush&rdquo; in the world of lithium</a>, due to the ever-increasing demand being driven both by the increase in popularity of lithium-ion batteries in electronics and the growing interest of such batteries for use in electric cars and for industrial uses. Tarascon notes that we simply aren&rsquo;t producing enough lithium to account for all the batteries we&rsquo;re going to need down the line. &ldquo;This alarming global situation will hopefully drive researchers to investigate new battery technologies and loosen our dependence on lithium,&rdquo; he added.</p>

<h3 id="could-lithium-become-the-21st-century-version-of-gold">Could lithium become the 21st century version of gold?</h3>

<p><strong>So here we have this material</strong> that&rsquo;s relatively common but not the easiest thing in the world to procure, that has a lot of key benefits to multiple industries.  (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkcJEvMcnEg">Kurt Cobain wasn&rsquo;t singing</a> about lithium&rsquo;s ability to charge his iPhone, just an FYI—he was singing about <a href="http://pro.psychcentral.com/the-incredible-the-amazing-lithium/001606.html">its value as a mental health drug</a>.)</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s got investors focused on raw materials seeing dollar signs. A key example of this is the site <a href="http://oilprice.com/">OilPrice.com</a>, which generally covers the oil industry but has given extra attention to lithium in recent months thanks to evidence that the material could become a huge boon as the electric car industry ramps up.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not since the shale boom have we seen a market transformation of such significance,&rdquo; <a href="http://oilprice.com/Energy/Energy-General/Warren-Buffett-And-Elon-Musk-To-Spark-A-Lithium-Boom.html">author James Stafford writes</a> with the excitement of a man who has bet the farm on a wacky metal. &ldquo;Lithium has long been used for a variety of mundane purposes, and while the variety is spectacular—with applications in everything from glass, ceramics and greases to a line-up of industrial process—it has flown under the radar for most investors.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Currently the industry is controlled largely by a handful of companies, though startups like Pure Energy Materials—again, seeing dollar signs—are attempting to get into the field. It&rsquo;s not an easy field to jump into, in large part because lithium quality greatly varies, and all the good stuff is in South America.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Though lithium isn’t rare in the environment, the cost of extraction varies greatly with its concentration and form,&rdquo; <a href="http://fortune.com/2015/04/26/lithium-mining/"><em>Fortune</em>&rsquo;s David Z. Morris wrote earlier this year</a>. &ldquo;With existing technology and present prices, truly profitable lithium comes only from the evaporation of highly concentrated brine.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Not that other companies aren&rsquo;t trying. Western Lithium, a startup working in both Nevada and Argentina, thinks that it&rsquo;s found a way to extract lithium from clay, which would offer the best of both worlds in terms of allowing mining but being as cheap as brine extraction. It could be a big boon if it ever gets off the ground—but <em>Fortune</em> notes that it&rsquo;s had a lot of trouble doing just that.</p>

<p>And with just a few companies leading the way in the market, it creates some challenges in terms of investing. But for those who aren&rsquo;t afraid of taking on a bunch of risk for the potential of a huge reward, investing might not sound like such a terrible idea. Hey, in two decades, this stuff could be worth a ton of money!</p>

<p>&ldquo;Remember, there’s no production yet, lots of things can go wrong, and these tips are for your speculative money only,&rdquo; investment writer Bengt Saelensminde <a href="http://moneyweek.com/six-ways-to-invest-in-lithium-batteries-of-the-future/">explained in <em>MoneyWeek</em></a> earlier this year. &ldquo;But this is also an industry in a state of flux. So getting in early could be hugely profitable – just don’t bet the house on it.&rdquo;</p>

</div>
<div class="md-graybox">
  <p><strong>Fossil fuels aren&rsquo;t going anywhere</strong> anytime soon, but the growth of lithium as a way to store energy and keep it for later allows us to imagine what the world would look like without oil driving everything. Lithium&rsquo;s ability to create a whole new set of winners and losers could have major geopolitical repercussions.</p>

<p>Beyond Bolivia and other parts of South America, one of those winners could very well be Afghanistan. Last year, <a href="http://www.sciencemag.org/content/345/6198/725.summary">USGS Afghanistan released a report</a> highlighting the wide array of minerals the war-torn country is sitting upon, and there&rsquo;s a huge potential for the country to make billions, if not trillions of dollars from launching mining operations. Among the materials discovered—beyond gold, silver, and mercury—was lithium.</p>

<p>But getting it out of the ground is far easier said than done.</p>

<p>&ldquo;One of the biggest challenges is security,&rdquo; <a href="http://www.livescience.com/47682-rare-earth-minerals-found-under-afghanistan.html">USGS Afghanistan&rsquo;s Jack Medlin told <em>LiveScience</em></a>. &ldquo;Another challenge is the lack of infrastructure. We&rsquo;re talking about access to energy, which is required to develop mines. We&rsquo;re talking access to roads, railroads and so forth. We&rsquo;re also talking about access to water, which is needed in most mining operations. It&rsquo;s all a big challenge, but it&rsquo;s doable. It won&rsquo;t happen overnight, but it&rsquo;s doable.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Suddenly, our smidgen of battery life feels a lot more significant.</p>
