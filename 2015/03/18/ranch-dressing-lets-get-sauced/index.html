  <p><strong>Today in Tedium:</strong> It was a business model that was destined to happen at some point. With overpriced lunches at fast-casual restaurants and unfortunate late-night fourthmeals at GrubHub alike sporting a certain buttermilk something-or-other at all times, someone was bound to build an entire restaurant concept around it—lest Sriracha get all the attention. And happen it did: Last week, word of a restaurant that includes ranch dressing in every single menu item (besides, we&rsquo;re assuming, the drinks—ranch milkshakes, everyone!) <a href="http://www.stlmag.com/dining/a-ranch-dressing-themed-restaurant%3F-oh-yeah,-and-it%E2%80%99s-coming/">surfaced out of St. Louis</a>. Fittingly, it&rsquo;s called &ldquo;<a href="http://www.twistedranch.com/">twisted RAnCh</a>,&rdquo; like a Limp Bizkit album from another dimension. Today, we&rsquo;re dedicating an entire issue of Tedium to ranch dressing. We guarantee you that this will be the only newsletter you&rsquo;ll ever receive dedicated to ranch dressing (until the next one). <em>— Ernie @ Tedium</em></p></p>

<h3 id="meanwhile-back-at-the-ranch">Meanwhile, back at the ranch …</h3>

<p><strong>To answer your question,</strong> ranch dressing did in fact come from a ranch. And yes, the name of that ranch was Hidden Valley.</p>

<p>But the route to fame didn&rsquo;t just start there.</p>

<p>It started in the Alaskan bush, where businessman Steve Henson—who played cook on top of his main gig as a plumber—came up with an idea to help calm down the workers annoyed that they had to eat salad.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s tough to feed men up in those bush jobs,&rdquo; the Nebraska native told <em>Los Angeles Times</em> food reporter Sergio Ortiz in 1999. &ldquo;If they don&rsquo;t like something, they&rsquo;re as likely to throw it at the cook as they are to walk out cursing. I had to come up with something to keep them happy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>(The source article isn&rsquo;t online in easily accessible form, <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/t3qr25roifiduwd/Hidden%20Valley%20founder%20whips%20buttermilk%2C%20mayo%20into%20legend.md?dl=0">but I did you a favor and put up a version of it here</a>.)</p>

<p>His solution involved a mixture of three fairly simple ingredients: mayo, buttermilk, and various herbs. It proved just the thing to get the workers to eat their vegetables.</p>

<p>That simple combination would come to save Henson and his dwindling nest egg after he finally launched the ranch of his dreams in 1954 outside of Santa Barbara, California.</p>

<p>Henson&rsquo;s dude ranch was essentially intended as a hideaway for tourists. It occasionally drew some, but it wasn&rsquo;t the ranch itself that was driving chatter after the fact. Rather, it was the dressing served on the salad.</p>

<p>Customers started asking for bottles to take home, some in increasing numbers. In one case, a visitor from Hawaii asked for 300 bottles at once. Henson and his wife couldn&rsquo;t make that many bottles in a short amount of time, so he instead offered the visitor a number of spice packets, telling him how to reproduce the recipe.</p>

<p>The visitor soon wanted more spice packets. Slowly but surely, the dressing became more popular than the ranch. And while Henson hoped to become rich with a ranch, the ranch he became rich from outgrew the far-off property from which he launched the company.</p>

<p>The world could not be kept away from this milky juggernaut.</p>

  <strong>The amount that</strong> the cleaning company conglomerate Clorox paid for Hidden Valley Ranch in 1972. The sauce became a major phenomenon after they figured out a way to preserve ranch dressing for long enough that it could be bottled and sold. (Though then again, it wasn&rsquo;t easy—Clorox food scientists spent nearly a decade trying to get it right, <a href="http://gladwell.com/the-bakeoff/">according to Malcom Gladwell</a>. It became a hit despite the the food scientists believing they had failed.) By 1992, ranch dressing was the most popular kind of salad dressing. Then—again, with a little push from Clorox—it became a hit condiment.

  <h3 id="five-unusual-contexts-for-ranch-dressing">Five unusual contexts for ranch dressing</h3>

<ol>
<li><strong>Because someone had to do it,</strong> a company called Rocket Fizz has been making a ranch dressing-flavored soda for the past couple of years. Here&rsquo;s a dude <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IEtzpiJGJNg">taste-testing it on YouTube</a> … for science.</li>
<li><strong>Prolific romance book novelist Janet Dailey</strong> became famous for writing books based in every single state, but the late author should be equally known for <a href="http://sfbne.ws/1MDDqob">titling a short story collection of hers <em>Ranch Dressing</em></a>. Someone had to do it.</li>
<li><strong>Speaking of things people had to do,</strong> the vegan food company <a href="http://organicvillefoods.com/">Organicville</a> makes a brand <a href="http://sfbne.ws/1DpTusf">of non-dairy ranch dressing</a>, which has roughly the number of calories as Hidden Valley&rsquo;s light dressing.</li>
<li><strong>All crazy food things</strong> must be inspired by 8-year-olds. Need evidence? If you find yourself near Whitefish, Montana anytime soon, <a href="http://www.sweetpeaksicecream.com/">ask Sweet Peaks Ice Cream</a> to serve you a cup of ranch dressing ice cream, a flavor that was inspired by the owners&rsquo; daughter and is <a href="http://www.womenshealthmag.com/node/41404">made from Hidden Valley Ranch packets</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Ranch dressing, like just about everything else,</strong> <a href="http://foodimentary.com/2014/03/10/march-10-is-national-ranch-dressing-day/">has its own day on the calendar</a>—and, sorry to say, you just missed it. Every March 10 is Ranch Dressing Day. Hidden Valley, of course, <a href="https://www.hiddenvalley.com/poll/">thinks that the dressing deserves its own month</a>.</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="ranch-across-borders">Ranch across borders</h3>

<p><strong>The ultra-fatty salad dressing concoction</strong> may be huge in the U.S., but outside of it, it&rsquo;s mostly a non-entity.</p>

<p>Nowhere is this perhaps as perfectly underlined <a href="http://laughingsquid.com/cool-american-doritos/">as it is in Iceland</a> and Norway, where it&rsquo;s a common sight to see convenience stores <a href="http://www.thrillist.com/eat/nation/cool-ranch-doritos-are-called-cool-american-in-europe">hawking &ldquo;Cool American&rdquo;-flavored Doritos</a>. The U.K. is in on the secrets of ranch dressing a little more than in other places outside of North America, but even there, <a href="http://www.tesco.com/groceries/product/details/?id=259009369">Doritos are called &ldquo;Cool Original&rdquo;</a>—despite the fact that ranch was never the original flavor of Doritos and only became a Doritos flavor in 1987.</p>

<p>In fact, Doritos (another popular example of an American junk food <a href="http://www.ocweekly.com/2012-04-05/food/taco-usa-how-mexican-food-conquered-america-doritos-disneyland/full/">with a fascinating origin story</a>) are something of the trojan horse on which ranch dressing is riding on into new markets.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9tP9ZYIlB_E">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9tP9ZYIlB_E</a></p>

<p>An example of that slow expansion: Last year, an Australian YouTuber named Elly Awesome <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9tP9ZYIlB_E">had a freakout moment</a> after discovering that Cool Ranch Doritos was being sold in her home country for the first time.</p>

<p>Ranch dressing hasn&rsquo;t reached all corners of the world in the way it has in the U.S., but American food chains like <a href="http://www.subwayarabia.com/home.php">the Middle Eastern version of Subway</a> and <a href="http://www.chilis.com.my/?page=sandwiches">the Malaysian version of Chili&rsquo;s</a> are helping to cover the world in dressing.</p>

<p>Eventually, they&rsquo;ll get assimilated into the buttermilk way of life.</p>

Okay, if people are going to keep asking for ranch, I thought it&rsquo;d be funny if I could find one of those &lsquo;in case of emergency break glass&rsquo; things. That&rsquo;s how it started, I went online searching for one that I thought would fit a ranch bottle.&rdquo;</h3>

<p><strong>— Jay Jerrier, the owner of a Dallas pizza restaurant</strong> called Cane Rosso, <a href="http://www.eater.com/2014/3/21/6257725/why-a-dallas-pizzeria-charges-1000-for-ranch-dressing">discussing with <em>Eater</em></a> how the pizzeria put a bottle of ranch dressing behind a glass case—and started charging, as a joke, $1,000 per side of the mayo-buttermilk concoction. The pizzeria&rsquo;s clever wall ornament became Reddit-famous last year.</p>

</div>

<div class="md-graybox">
  <p><strong>&ldquo;Buttermilk is a good base for anything.</strong> You can use it to make a hundred things in the kitchen,&rdquo; Steve Henson said in his 1999 _Los Angeles Times_ interview. &ldquo;I experimented with other mayonnaise-type dressings, too, but they just don&rsquo;t have the consistency of a real mayo and buttermilk mix.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Henson&rsquo;s greatest work has evolved into a pop-culture punchline, seen as a quick way to mock the gluttonous ways that Americans eat. Certainly, there&rsquo;s a good point there: we literally throw a gloppy mix of buttermilk and mayo (two of the higher-fat options in one&rsquo;s fridge) onto just about everything, not thinking of the damage it&rsquo;s causing us. As sauces go, <a href="http://dailyhealthpost.com/the-5-healthiest-5-worst-condiments-for-your-body/">you&rsquo;re better off</a> with mustard, salsa, or hummus if you&rsquo;re watching your dainty figure.</p>

<p>(The salad-dressing industry realizes that ranch could eventually become a target of Michelle Obama and company and has tried to play up its role as an accent to healthier foods. Then again, <a href="http://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052702303299604577323653752204874">Clorox also did create a thicker, dip-style version of the sauce</a>, calling it &ldquo;the new ketchup.&rdquo;)</p>

<p>But Henson, who died in 2007 at the age of 89, <a href="http://www.omaha.com/go/the-story-of-the-nebraska-cowboy-who-invented-ranch-dressing/article_8f2d023e-5cf7-521f-aeda-55c59729583f.html">was clearly onto something</a>, even if he didn&rsquo;t see most of the profits from his most successful business effort.</p>

<p>Clorox, despite not owning a patent on the flavor, has managed to keep its finger on the pulse of what consumers want out of ranch dressing the same way a blogger might keep pace on an important news story: According to the <em>WSJ</em>, it follows Google Trends and sees how people are talking about using the sauce, then uses that to concoct new variants <a href="https://www.hiddenvalley.com/products/bottled-dressings/">like &ldquo;Fiesta Salsa Ranch,&rdquo; &ldquo;Avocado Ranch,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Cheese Ranch.&rdquo;</a></p>

<p>We expect Hidden Valley to produce a Sriracha Ranch any day now.</p>
