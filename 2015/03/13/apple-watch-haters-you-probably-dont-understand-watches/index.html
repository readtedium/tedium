  <strong>Today in Tedium:</strong> If someone <a href="http://store.apple.com/us/buy-watch/apple-watch-edition">shows you a $10,000 watch</a>, do you understand its inherent value, or do you roll your eyes? Do you think <a href="http://bgr.com/2015/03/12/apple-watch-edition-price-10000-dollars/">it looks ugly</a>? Do you think that watches that cost a quarter of the average American&rsquo;s salary make any sense whatsoever? Do you see them <a href="http://fusion.net/story/53028/does-apples-future-depend-on-income-inequality/">as an opportunity</a> to play up <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2015/03/with-its-10000-watch-apple-has-lost-its-soul/387316/">the class wars</a> a little more? Or are you a techie thinking about watches in terms of that <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/the-switch/wp/2015/03/10/the-quiet-computing-revolution-built-into-apples-12-inch-macbook/">awesome laptop with the USB-C port</a>? There&rsquo;s a good chance you are. It&rsquo;s OK! But before you complain about Apple selling a $10,000 watch, do us all a favor and learn a little more about the watch industry, willya? <em>— Ernie @ Tedium</em>

  <strong>The amount that</strong> the original Apple Macintosh would cost if were launched at 2015&rsquo;s inflation rate, according the the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. Back in 1984, the launch price was $2,495, which was seen as relatively cheap for the level of innovation being offered. It&rsquo;s especially worth keeping in mind that the Apple Lisa <a href="http://www.macworld.com/article/2025408/30-years-of-the-apple-lisa-and-the-apple-iie.html">launched a year earlier at a $9,995 price</a>—which would be $23,342 today.

<h3 id="why-rolex-doesn-t-outsource-stuff">Why Rolex doesn&rsquo;t outsource stuff</h3>

<p><strong>Here&rsquo;s the thing</strong> that makes Apple different from Rolex corporately.</p>

<p>Apple uses dozens of contractors like Foxconn to make the various parts that ultimately show up in your laptop or phone. It&rsquo;s an approach that generally works out OK, though there are cases where the whole damn mess breaks down.</p>

<p>Rolex, however, is a 100 percent vertically integrated company, meaning they make _everything_ that shows up in their watches, from the steel to the quartz.</p>

<p>Like Apple, they do things that on the surface seem absurd—<a href="http://www.ablogtowatch.com/10-things-know-rolex-makes-watches/">like making an extremely expensive kind of steel</a> because it looks a little better—but play perfectly into their no-compromises strategy.</p>

<p>Ariel Adams, an expert on luxury timepieces, says this kind of M.O. flows through the whole corporation.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Imagine a spaceship flying through space on a very serious mission,&rdquo;<a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/arieladams/2013/12/05/inside-rolex-understanding-the-worlds-most-impressive-watch-maker/">he wrote for _Forbes_ back in 2013</a>. &ldquo;The spaceship even has people on-board who can improve the ship while it is in motion. When the spaceship left earth it was told that it had a sole mission, to travel as far into space as possible. That is kind of like Rolex.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The move towards vertical integration is relatively recent: in the 1990s, the Switzerland-based company decided to slowly start moving in this direction. But it was only in 2012, when the company opened a factory in Bienne (shown above), when it managed to fulfill this mission.</p>

<p>But beyond this whole vertical-integration thing, it makes sense to compare Apple and Rolex. As the _Financial Times_ notes, <a href="http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/eb3acd7c-3155-11df-9741-00144feabdc0.html#axzz3UCrwggbN">Rolex is famous for being incredibly secretive</a>, just like Apple is. And like Steve Jobs, Rolex founder Hans Wilsdorf had an obsession with greatness that topped low prices most of the time.</p>

<p>“It is not with low prices but, on the contrary, it is with improved quality that we can not only hold the market but improve,” Wilsdorf wrote in 1912.</p>

<p><a href="http://sfbne.ws/1EfDsii">Rolex regularly sells watches</a> that cost more than Macbooks. So maybe it makes sense that Apple wants a piece of that market.</p>

<ol>
<li>If you have a friend who owns a <strong>Jaeger-LeCoultre Hybris Mechanica à Grande Sonnerie</strong>, there&rsquo;s a good chance <a href="http://www.jaeger-lecoultre.com/US/en/watches/hybris-mechanica-a-grande-sonnerie/6033420#/t1">your friend was born into money</a>. The watch, which chimes just like Big Ben, costs $1,474,070.</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://www.greubelforsey.com/en/collection/art-piece-1">The Greubel Forsey Art Piece 1</a></strong> includes a tiny sculpture of a ship inside of its crown. It&rsquo;ll <a href="http://www.wired.com/2014/09/1-5-million-watch-microscopic-sculpture-inside/">put you back about $1.5 million</a>.</li>
<li>Some of <strong>Graham&rsquo;s Chronofighter</strong> watches—notable for the trigger-style crown on the side—dip below the $10,000 mark, but if you want them in gold, <a href="http://www.luxuryofwatches.com/graham-chronofighter-1695-2cxap-s03a/?gclid=CjwKEAjw8oSoBRCss4qDrP3Y7yUSJACKumZ9BySiCacz5aKdo6JjRbpXZiEgYOgzmSckD88CUc9h-hoCKlvw_wcB">you&rsquo;ll be paying more than that</a>.</li>
<li>When swinging around a racquet, <strong>Rafael Nadal generally wears a $690,000 watch</strong>. The watch maker Richard Mille makes a watch <a href="http://www.richardmille.com/watch/rm-035-01/?collection=homme">specifically for Nadal</a>, and two others specifically for Jackie Chan.</li>
<li>The <a href="https://www.patek.com/contents/default/en/5296R_010.html"><strong>Patek Philippe Calatrava</strong></a> tops the $10k mark of the lowest-cost Apple Watch. Arguably, though, the Apple Watch has more gold going on.</li>
</ol>

</div>

<div class="md-whitebox">
  <p><img src="https://tedium.imgix.net/2018/01/isknx3jqdfvwr2io4sgz.jpg" alt="EONE Watch" /></p>

<h3 id="here-s-a-watch-worth-respecting-no-matter-your-price-range">Here&rsquo;s a watch worth respecting, no matter your price range</h3>

<p><strong>If we can&rsquo;t necessarily sell you on the idea</strong> that the Apple Watch Edition is about average in the context of the watch that it&rsquo;s competing with, perhaps we can at least tell you about a freaking awesome watch that costs less than an Apple Watch Sport—but has a pretty awesome angle to it.</p>

<p>The startup <a href="https://eone-time.com/">EONE</a> got its start back in 2013, when <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/eone/the-bradley-a-timepiece-designed-to-touch-and-see">it launched its timepiece on Kickstarter</a>. The watch looks rather snazzy, but what makes it really impressive is that it&rsquo;s designed for an audience that tends not to be remembered by most watchmakers—those who can&rsquo;t see.</p>

<p>The EONE Bradley, named for <a href="http://www.npr.org/2012/09/07/160674083/a-year-after-war-wound-american-wins-paralympics">paralympic swimmer Bradley Snyder</a>, uses magnets to tell time—and does well at it. If you move the magnets, they move back into place, in a way that&rsquo;s easy to follow if you can&rsquo;t see them. And here&rsquo;s the best part: If you can see the watch, you&rsquo;d have no idea that it was designed for the visually impaired. It looks so snazzy that just 1 to 2 percent of its buyers are within its initial target audience.</p>

<p>“You don’t need to come up with a whole new technology to serve minorities,” Eone founder Hyungsoo Kim <a href="http://technical.ly/dc/2015/01/05/eone-dc-watches-hyungsoo-kim/">said in an interview with<em>Technical.ly</em></a> earlier this year.</p>

<p>And it&rsquo;s a price that most people can afford, too—<a href="http://shopna.eone-time.com/">the high-end model</a>tops out at a still-cheaper-than-an-Apple-Watch-Sport $315.</p>

</div>

<div class="md-graybox">
  <p><strong>I don&rsquo;t really have a horse in this race.</strong> I&rsquo;ve only owned one or two watches in my life—given to me as gifts—and they&rsquo;ve never really been a big deal for me like they are for some people. (I do have a Jawbone—also a gift—which I find to be useful.)</p>

<p>But the problem that I see with the way that people have gone insane over the Apple Watch in recent days is something of perspective. I&rsquo;m not saying that Apple necessarily is making many friends by selling a watch that costs more than some people make in a year—but that it&rsquo;s merely working within the context of an already established product sector.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Consider: Apple, with its $650 cellphones and $1,500 computers, already makes perhaps the fifth or sixth most expensive item in a high-income household, right behind furniture, luxury goods, TV’s, cars, and homes. And guess what? They’re now in the luxury goods business,&ldquo; <a href="http://www.wired.com/2015/03/apple-watchs-highlow-branding-insane-economies-scale/">_Wired_ writer Cliff Kuang wrote this week</a>.</p>

<p>We don&rsquo;t have to like the fact that watches cost this much. We don&rsquo;t have to like the fact that Apple now makes watches this expensive. But can we appreciate that we may not in fact be the target audience for this bling—and that&rsquo;s no reason to hate it?</p>
