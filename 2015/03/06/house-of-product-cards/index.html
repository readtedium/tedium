  <strong>Today in Tedium:</strong> Last weekend, you may have been like me and binged on <em>House of Cards</em>. Along the way, you may have spotted a few direct references to big-name brands … many of which may have paid for the chance to be on screen with Frank Underwood and <a href="http://sfbne.ws/18Vq9ZU"><em>SPOILER ALERT</em></a>. But the nature of products on screen and elsewhere have become so prevalent that they just bleed into the action after a while—subliminally influencing us along the way. In today&rsquo;s issue, we give product <em>(PLANTERS PEANUTS!)<em> placement its </em>(TACO BELL!)</em> notice. <em>— Ernie @ Tedium</em>
</span></p>

</div>

<div class="md-graybox">
  <p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4hP2fL8liE">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4hP2fL8liE</a></p>

<h3 id="a-phenomenon-as-old-as-movies-themselves">A phenomenon as old as movies themselves</h3>

<p><strong>In 1888, the first known work of moving picture made its turn on the screen,</strong> when the inventor Louis Le Prince produced his groundbreaking &ldquo;Roundhay Garden Scene.&rdquo; It was impressive and downright mind-blowing. (Le Prince, however, <a href="http://blog.nationalmediamuseum.org.uk/2013/08/29/louis-le-prince-created-the-first-ever-moving-pictures/">disappeared before he had a chance</a> to see his invention take over the world.)</p>

<p>Nearly as mind-blowing as what happened in a garden that day was a short film that came eight years later. Inventive Swiss marketer François-Henri Lavanchy-Clarke, who worked for Lever Brothers near the turn of the century, was one of the first to see the advertising potential of cinematography.</p>

<p>Lavanchy-Clarke used moving film to hold events as a way to promote the Sunlight Soap, <a href="http://victorian-cinema.net/lavanchyclarke">_Who&rsquo;s Who of Victorian Cinema_ notes</a>, but there were times that he took it beyond the point of mere association.</p>

<p>Two 1896 films masterminded by Lavanchy-Clarke have the rightful stake on being called the first &ldquo;product placement,&rdquo; depending on what you think the term might mean. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UxkJbC2-EuY">&ldquo;Wash Day,&rdquo; which came first</a>, was more overt about its promotion of the Sunlight brand, which might make it closer to the first advertisement. It showed a family washing clothes using the soap.</p>

<p>But <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4hP2fL8liE">&ldquo;Défilé du 8e bataillon,&rdquo; which came later that year</a>, was more subtle. Showing off a parade, the branding of the 45-second clip doesn&rsquo;t take hold until about halfway in, when a wheelbarrow suddenly shows up on the scene—sporting a logo for Sunlight Soap. That&rsquo;s kind of how product placements generally work. If the former doesn&rsquo;t count as a product placement—but rather, as the first commercial—this one definitely stands out as a product placement.</p>

<p>From there, product placement slowly began to grow. In 1927, the first Oscar winner for Best Picture, <em>Wings</em>, <a href="http://www.businesspundit.com/10-surprising-examples-of-product-placement-in-classic-cinema/">prominently featured a bar of Hershey&rsquo;s chocolate</a>, ensuring that it would become a trivia question for generations to come.</p>

<p>In recent years, these ad placements have become more prominent for two reasons: First, they help subsidize a film or television program&rsquo;s production costs somewhat seamlessly, and they actually work a lot better than the alternative. Like Mr. Clean next to a tub full of grime, it&rsquo;s nice to have them around.</p>

<p>&ldquo;When products are inserted into storylines, they can be more effective than traditional ads. They’re better at grabbing attention. They can be more cost efficient,&ldquo; <a href="http://priceonomics.com/the-economics-of-product-placements/">the quite-excellent blog _Priceonomics_ noted in 2013</a>. &ldquo;They can’t be muted or skipped over the way typical ads can be. And yes, research shows that they’re highly influential—particularly when used to generate positive impressions of a brand or to change consumers’ perceptions about a product.&rdquo;</p>

<p>They&rsquo;re easy to parody—the 1992 classic _Wayne&rsquo;s World_ featured an amusing scene <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lgLYGBbDNs">that parodied product placement</a> while accepting money for product placement—but as Rob Lowe put it in that movie, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry you feel that way, but basically it&rsquo;s the nature of the beast.&rdquo;</p>

<p>When you can put Oreos in a scene of a popular TV show, it means that another production manager gets his wings. Easy as that.</p>

  <p><strong>The number of brand placements</strong> in last year&rsquo;s_Transformers_ film, <em>Age of Extinction</em>, <a href="http://www.brandchannel.com/home/post/2015/02/20/150220-2015-Brandcameo-Product-Placement-Awards.aspx">according to the website <em>BrandChannel</em></a>. Being a global franchise (and partly set in China), the Michael Bay crapfest didn&rsquo;t just have brands popular with Americans. It had a number of Chinese brands, including Lukfook and Yili milk, represented. It also had a pretty egregious brand placement from Beats Music, which_BrandChannel_ called the year&rsquo;s worst.</p></p>

<h3 id="the-future-of-brand-placement-is-six-seconds-long">The future of brand placement is six seconds long</h3>

<p><strong>Twitter&rsquo;s Vine service</strong> has created minor celebrities out of creative teenagers—and like a lot of social networks, the monetization opportunities weren&rsquo;t obvious at first. <em>(This paragraph is sponsored by Hardee&rsquo;s.)</em></p>

<p>But just as a fast as Denny&rsquo;s got its hash browns on Fleek, the brands came to the clever Vine stars. <a href="https://vine.co/tags/ShareaCoke">Bottles of Coca-Cola</a> _(Editor&rsquo;s note: RC Cola)_ got handed out to some of these kids with immense speed. And it&rsquo;s understandable why—in a matter of months, some of the more talented six-second artistes had managed to create follower bases in the millions, as well as driving loops on their videos even quicker than that.</p>

<p>The looping nature of the videos is pretty epic from a brand standpoint, too. Marketing is all about repeating brand messages—the term &ldquo;effective frequency,&ldquo; <a href="https://www.insightexpress.com/docs/default-source/white-papers/the-effect-of-frequency-over-time.pdf?sfvrsn=2">how branding becomes more effective over time</a>, is a pretty good way to think about this—and when something&rsquo;s repeated, you&rsquo;re more likely to remember it. Vine repeats those messages over and over again—making it a perfect marketing vehicle.</p>

Vine repeats those messages over and over again—making it a perfect marketing vehicle.<em>(Yes, I posted this paragraph twice to feel more like a Vine user. Sorry.)</em></p>

<p><a href="http://mashable.com/2014/07/22/sneaky-vine-ads/">A piece from _Mashable_ last year</a> did a great job of explaining this phenomenon in action.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not unlike product placement in the film and television industry, Vine ads are cropping up in cases where the product can be worked in as part of the sketch,&rdquo; the publication&rsquo;s Kurt Wagner wrote. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s such a lucrative business, in fact, that advertising and talent agencies are taking a piece of the action, serving as middlemen while connecting Vine&rsquo;s biggest influencers to brands that want social reach.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Twitter clearly thinks this is where things are going—<a href="http://techcrunch.com/2015/02/11/twitter-acquires-niche-a-startup-that-helps-advertisers-work-with-social-media-celebrities/">that&rsquo;s why it spent millions to acquire a startup called Niche</a>, which puts advertisers together with social media superstars.</p>

<p>When it comes to product placements, we&rsquo;ve come a long way from wheelbarrows.</p>

</div>

<div class="md-redbox">
  <div class="md-quote">
  <h3 id="what-i-offer-having-access-to-the-other-side-of-the-world-which-is-access-to-entertainment-and-film-and-talent-and-athletes-and-television-digital-music">&ldquo;What I offer: having access to the other side of the world, which is access to entertainment and film and talent and athletes and television, digital, music.&rdquo;</h3>

<p><strong>— Ryan Kavanaugh,</strong> the CEO of Relativity Media, <a href="http://www.wsj.com/articles/coming-soon-to-theaters-near-you-e-cigarettes-1410748204">discussing how his place on the board of the e-cigarette company Vapor</a> was a win-win situation for both the film industry and the e-cigarette industry. Slowly but surely, films like his—along with those produced by other studios, like the upcoming _Cymbeline_—are helping to give e-cigarettes some wanted notice.</p>

</div>

<div class="md-graybox">
  <p><strong>Here&rsquo;s the thing about product placement:</strong> It cuts both ways, and if it means that a company has to avoid an unflattering placement, that&rsquo;s what they&rsquo;re gonna do. The Oscar-winning 2008 film _Slumdog Millionaire_ had that problem: Corporations like Mercedes-Benz and Coca-Cola were _not_ cool with their brands showing up in the poorest parts of Mumbai, which required director Danny Boyle to remove references to the products in various scenes, at a cost of tens of thousands of dollars.</p>

<p>&ldquo;In terms of the Western audience, they don&rsquo;t really want to see their products being associated with what they regard as &lsquo;slums,&rsquo; the way that they think of slums, you know?&ldquo; <a href="http://adage.com/article/madisonvine-news/coke-mercedes-avoid-gritty-film-cameos-slumdog/132301/">Boyle told _Ad Age_ in 2008</a>. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not to do with the Indian perspective of slums, because people in India know that &lsquo;slums&rsquo; is a geographical reference; it&rsquo;s not a pejorative term there at all.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But what brands are OK with is weird. In the new season of <em>House of Cards</em>, there&rsquo;s a shot where (spoiler alert) a character is shooting up bourbon with a syringe next to a bag of Golden Oreos.</p>

<p>In what world does that make someone say, &ldquo;I want a freaking Oreo&rdquo;?</p>
