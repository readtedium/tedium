  <strong>Today in Tedium:</strong> In their own quiet ways, spelling and grammar are each forms of lobbying. Language is one of the few facts of everyday life that started out as a variety of opinions on what things should be called. And those opinions, <a href="http://money.cnn.com/2015/11/19/investing/second-biggest-diamond-lucara/">like a diamond pressed into form</a>, slowly molded into a definitive shape. But there&rsquo;s a limit to how much we&rsquo;re OK with as a society—hence the popularity of dictionaries and <a href="http://amzn.to/1QxsMUB">style guides</a>, which draw up a map for how we use words on a daily basis. At times, though, the push for changes to the English language has gotten extremely political. Today&rsquo;s Tedium tries to get the last word in. <em>— Ernie @ Tedium</em>

<p><strong>— Noah Webster,</strong> writing in the <em>A Compendious Dictionary of the English Language</em> <a href="https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/A_Compendious_Dictionary_of_the_English_Language">of the challenges of the English Language</a>. The 1806 book was the first true American dictionary, and it was a very opinionated work, one that attempted to scale back the complexities that pocked the English language at the time, while calling out &ldquo;the corruption of language by means of heedless writers.&rdquo; It didn&rsquo;t make sense to him that &ldquo;colour&rdquo; had a u in it, so he just removed it. Likewise, <a href="http://www.merriam-webster.com/info/spelling-reform.htm">it seemed strange that &ldquo;publick&rdquo; had the extra k, so off it went</a>. Webster&rsquo;s strategy of whittling away at letters was controversial, but it largely worked—though not every change took, a number of them did. His work inspired later spelling reformers.</p>

<h3 id="andrew-carnegie-once-funded-an-organization-that-lobbied-to-simplify-words">Andrew Carnegie once funded an organization that lobbied to simplify words</h3>

<p><strong>In a lot of ways,</strong> <a href="http://amzn.to/1NfkIY7">Andrew Carnegie</a> was a study in contradictions. He was an empire-builder who wanted to give away the fruits of his labor as soon as he received them. He was a progressively-minded philanthropist whose company oversaw <a href="http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/amex/carnegie/peopleevents/pande04.html">one of the deadliest anti-unionization battles</a> in U.S. history—one, to be fair, he deeply regretted after the fact.</p>

<p>And he was a man who built thousands of libraries in his name—funding most of <a href="http://library.columbia.edu/locations/rbml/units/carnegie/andrew.html">the more than 2,500 libraries he built</a> without asking any questions—but had a vested interest in making the English language as simple as possible.</p>

<p>That desire for a simpler English language led Carnegie to help found and fund the Simplified Spelling Board, an organization designed to make the language more obvious and phonetic. Carnegie&rsquo;s reason for funding the organization in 1906 was an attempt to help push forward the idea of making English the global language.</p>

<p>His approach was even more aggressive than Webster&rsquo;s. It had no interest in graceful-looking words. The Simplified Spelling Board eyed changes that would have made the dictionary fully phonetic, with little variation from the way words are actually said. Words like &ldquo;woe&rdquo; would have become &ldquo;wo&rdquo; and &ldquo;though&rdquo; would have devolved into &ldquo;tho.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Carnegie, being a rich man with a lot of political clout, knew that influence was the key factor necessary to push these ideas &ldquo;thru.&rdquo; So his organization started by trying to convince a number of famous authors to begin to use the new spellings in their books—and scored big names <a href="http://amzn.to/1NfkMXG">like Mark Twain</a>, convincing them to simplify a handful of particularly frustrating words like &ldquo;altho&rdquo; and &ldquo;catalog.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But then the board bit off more than the American public could chew. Soon, the group&rsquo;s list of 12 words grew to more than 300, and the influence game reached all the way to Teddy Roosevelt, <a href="http://history1900s.about.com/od/1900s/qt/trspelling.htm">who became a big fan of the concept</a> and soon ordered the Government Printing Office to use <a href="http://s.wsj.net/public/resources/documents/info-SPELLING0805.html">the list of words</a> for all official government documents.</p>

<p>As anyone who follows politics today can tell you, there&rsquo;s nothing that some people hate more than feeling like they&rsquo;re being told what to do by the federal government—and soon, both Congress and the media were hating on the idea of a dramatic attempt to Americanize the English language. Within weeks of Roosevelt&rsquo;s call, the House passed a bill to prevent the change from going through and the president, sensing a losing battle was on his hands, quickly backed down.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am sory as a dog,&rdquo; Twain wrote to Carnegie of the failure. &ldquo;For I do lov revolutions and violense.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Despite the embarrassing loss on the phonetics front, Carnegie kept funding the Simplified Spelling Board for nearly a decade afterwards, stopping after it became clear that his attempt to influence the country to spell differently had failed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think I hav been patient long enuf,&rdquo; <a href="http://www.post-gazette.com/frontpage/2006/06/01/Karnege-s-plan-wud-hav-speled-big-changes/stories/200606010346">he wrote as he cancelled the funding in 1915</a>. &ldquo;I hav a much better use for twenty-five thousand dollars a year.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Back then, $25,000 was real money—the equivalent of more than half a million dollars now. It&rsquo;s a crazy amount of money to spend on anything—let alone words.</p>

<p><strong>— A line from the intro of <a href="https://archive.org/details/handbookofsimpli00simprich">the <em>Handbook of Simplified Spelling</em></a>,</strong> a book published by the Simplified Spelling Board in 1920—the year the board disbanded, five years after it had seen its funding fall apart. The spelling of &ldquo;ar&rdquo; and &ldquo;spel&rdquo; is the same as the book uses, by the way.</p>

<ol>
<li><em><strong>&ldquo;Do I need to hit you over the head</strong> with those numerous examples from Fowler? Or will you, dammit, cave in and begin to write English instead of journalese?&rdquo;</em> — John McIntyre, a copy editor and blogger for <em>The Baltimore Sun</em>, <a href="http://johnemcintyre.blogspot.com/2009/06/damn-you-ap-stylebook.html">expressing frustration with the “split verb” rule</a> in the AP Stylebook.</li>
<li><em><strong>&ldquo;While you’re trying to stay relevant,</strong> you’re needlessly filling my mind with information that is easily obtained elsewhere.&rdquo;</em> — Daniel Hunt, a designer and copy editor currently with the Sacramento Bee, in an American Society of Copy Editors blog post <a href="http://www.copydesk.org/board/2010/02/10/an-open-letter-to-the-ap-stylebook/">criticizing the AP Stylebook&rsquo;s editors</a> for adding too many entries.</li>
<li><em><strong>&ldquo;Would we talk about gravity doubters?</strong> What about people who doubt the link between smoking and lung cancer? In no other circumstance would the complete rejection of science be treated so gently.&rdquo;</em> — Ryan Grim, the Washington bureau chief for <em>The Huffington Post</em>, criticizing the AP <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/ap-climate-change-deniers_560204dee4b08820d91ac3b0">for its guidance against using the term &ldquo;climate change denier,&rdquo;</a> which the organization announced in September.</li>
<li><em><strong>&ldquo;For three decades, I have included</strong> that final comma in a series only to watch helplessly as my journalism editors pluck it out with tweezers.&rdquo;</em> — Roy Peter Clark, an educator at the Poynter Institute, <a href="http://www.poynter.org/how-tos/journalism-education/256443/ap-style-should-adopt-the-oxford-comma/">discussing how the AP Stylebook&rsquo;s longstanding rule</a> against the Oxford comma has frustrated him, left his copy missing something, and is slowly going out of style.</li>
<li><em><strong>&ldquo;Whenever a change is made to the AP Stylebook,</strong> I curl up in the shape of a comma and emit loud cries.&rdquo;</em> — <em>Washington Post</em> humorist Alexandra Petri, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/compost/wp/2014/03/26/for-the-ap-stylebook-its-more-than-over/">discussing the decision by the Associated Press</a> to allow &ldquo;more than&rdquo; and &ldquo;over&rdquo; to be used interchangeably in front of numbers.</li>
</ol>

</div>
<div class="md-graybox">
  <p><strong>So here&rsquo;s the fun part about</strong> the Simplified Spelling Board. While the organization went away nearly 100 years ago, other organizations still exist, and they&rsquo;re still active to this day.</p>

<p>Problem is, they don&rsquo;t have anyone near as powerful as Andrew Carnegie, Theodore Roosevelt, or Mark Twain to make their case. So they&rsquo;ve been forced to switch strategies. One of the strategies these groups have taken is to protest spelling bees. No, I&rsquo;m not kidding.</p>

<p>In 2010, protesters from the <a href="http://www.americanliteracy.com/">American Literacy Council</a> and the <a href="http://spellingsociety.org/">English Spelling Society</a> descended on the Scripps National Spelling Bee, arguing that the whole idea behind the contest was a sham, and that words should be more phonetic.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Enuf is enuf. Enough is too much,&rdquo; <a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/news/spelling-bee-protesters-enough-is-enuf/">one of their signs said</a>.</p>

<p><em>New Yorker</em> writer Eileen Reynolds, responding to the bizarre protest, <a href="http://www.newyorker.com/books/page-turner/dont-like-english-spelling-tuf-luk">basically stated the obvious</a>: the mission is a lost cause, and the final result would be nothing worth celebrating.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The spellings of words tell stories. They tell us something about the history of words—the long or short journeys they took before reaching us,&rdquo; she wrote. &ldquo;I’ll cling to the dreaded ough endings for as long as I live, because they remind me of the fascinating and chaotic period of the language’s history known as Middle English.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Perhaps words aren&rsquo;t designed to be perfectly phonetic. Maybe we just have to accept their wrinkles for what they are.</p>
